She turned and slowly walked out as soon as she was out of the doorway I ran to the hall to find it was empty. There was no way she could get to her room at the speed she was walking and I would have heard her run but everything stayed silent. I went to my sisters room where I found her asleep in pajama pants and a tee shirt. A couple months ago I learned my mom had been seeing the same girl for years</p>

It was about 5 years ago when i was little visiting my grandparents house. I was sleeping on the couch where you could see the kitchen to your left and front door with the stairs to the right which was lighted by one bright light. I was dreaming about cockroaches (which i was terrified of then) and i woke up in the middle of the night. So, when i woke up my head was laying in a way that the first thing i saw was the front door and the stairs and my glance around my surroundings started there. And i looked to the kitchen. No one there. </p>

<p>But then i looked to my right, and that&#39;s when i saw the little girl... Staring directly at me in a white old timely night gown (or a white dress type thing that went down to the ankles) and black/dark hair which went to her shoulders. And For some weird reason (i was still little back then) i thought that if i pretended that i didn&#39;t see her (although i stared at her for like 10 seconds in complete shock) she wouldnt &quot;come after me&quot;. So i looked into the kitchen and back to where the girl was standing. She was gone. And after a few minutes, the tiny modern toy rocking horse we kept in the living room started rocking. And it kept on rocking for a couple minutes strait. Somehow i got back to sleep that night after the rocking stopped. </p>

<p>Why i remember that so clearly is bc that is the only paranormal experience i ever had even though i still don&#39;t believe in ghosts BUT, i am open to it if they were real.</p>

<p>When i was 8 or 9 i would come home from school and sit inside at my front window and read. The sun had gotten awfully bright, and it had been raining all afternoon. 
I looked up at the sun then got up to go close the curtains. A figure in a white dress caught my attention. 
She looked about the same age as me. She was blonde and incredibly pale. She was sitting on the lawn of the house accross the street. Way out in the open, but she wasn&#39;t wet even though it had been raining...
No kids lived in that house, so it wasn&#39;t her yard to be sitting in. The couple that lived there were friends of my grandfather. I thought it was a reflection so i looked toward their front door to see what it was. I didn&#39;t see anything, but when i looked back to where the girl was sitting she was gone.
We lived in a trailer park, the only way she could have gotten up and walked away was to walk right past my front window, i never saw anything walk past. However that weekend i could singing coming from behind the tree in my yard. I asked my dad if he had heard it, and he said he thought it was me.

We lived in Maryland at the time in a small two story house in a quiet secluded neighborhood. My parents not thinking I’d wake up didn’t leave get a sitter or call a friend to sit at the house until they got back. It was maybe 2:30-3 AM when I woke up to the sound of thudding downstairs. My room is right across from my parents so I opened the door to tell them I heard something no response and I soon realized they weren’t home. I tried not to panic but as a small under average height scrawny 6 year old my mind began racing and I became deathly afraid. I grabbed one of my dads golf clubs out of his bag and slowly and stealthily made my way down stairs. All the while I still heard the thudding and I went to the kitchen slowly peeking around the corner. Then I see right in the window of our kitchen a delusional or insane homeless man lightly banging his head on the window. I was so afraid I didn’t even think to call the cops and I didn’t know my parents numbers. I ran back upstairs with the gold club and sat against my door hoping he couldn’t get inside. Eventually he must’ve moved on because the thudding stopped and my parents got home shortly after. I never told my parents about it but it still gives me chills to think about it.</p>

I would be depriving myself of sleep for so long each night for 4 nights straight obviously leading to not so pleasant results which would then keep me up because I was scared that if I fell asleep there was a chance the hallucinations could kill me which was silly to say the least. After convincing myself to sleep I woke up hours later not being able to move. It was almost sunrise and light had seeped through the windows which was somewhat comforting but I’m not a morning person. A couple of seconds later I started seeing a spider crawl on my window which had freaked me out but had scared me due to the fact I couldn’t escape. Not only was it one but now the whole window was blackened out because of the spiders and eventually I got the tingling sensation of spiders crawling on me, but oh ho ho you would be mistaken if that’s where you thought that ended. After closing my eyes in fear I saw gaping holes in my arm and passed out in fear. I still remember it to this day and golly I hope it never happens again</p>

<p>In short sleep paralysis is what you explained.
Not sleeping for long periods of time will cause you to hallucinate visually and aurally ( audio/ sound ) and my body kinda did the thing which you said but I didn’t need to explain to you because you obviously knew what it was and you know that sleep paralysis is still you in REM sleep but not being able to move because your brain thinks your awake. For the all the people who didn’t know, there you go I guess</p>

<p>Have a good day by the way :)</p>

I&#39;m terrified at this point. As I get a better look at him I notice he had a load of make up on,  he looked like a clown, I thought &quot;is this a prank?&quot;.

Then I realized he had a huge kitchen knife in his jacket I was paralyzed, I then jumped out of bed and sprinted for my parents room. No one was in there. I turned around and ran down stairs, and out the front door. I saw my parents. They were there outside, waiting. I told the, there was a man inside, they then said. &quot;We know&quot;. They were incredibly happy to see me they told me they had called the police. When the police checked the house, they didn&#39;t find him. But what they did find has left me scared for life. When they checked the attic, they looked inside a huge wardrobe. They found empty wrappers, knives and empty water bottles. He had been living in my house for god knows how long.</p>

Well that night I had gone to bed around 10 pm ish, so I should have been sound asleep, being 11 or so it was difficult on me, but I had woke up. I was a little freaked out but I tend to just go to bed again, but something in me forced me to stay awake. I looked to my parents bedroom (my door is broken so it&#39;s always open and my parents bedroom door is right in my view at all times.) Being on the top bunk I had a better view. The door had sudden opened, making no noise, their door is pretty squeaky but I didn&#39;t think anything of it, maybe they had opened the door gently. No. That wasn&#39;t it. A boys face peeked around the corner of the frame, his face seemingly smushed between the door and the frame. And then he just slips out. My parents bedroom door closed. He seemed around 12, young. Obviously too short to be face to face with me.but some how, when he gluided over to me he was right in my face. Fear kept me still as I watched. He had short blonde hair, like golden blonde, blue eyes, and fairly pale skin, he was pretty thin. He had a red shirt on and blue jeans shorts. After seeing him for a split second left. I went straight to bed. Like what I was supposed to see was seen and I could go back to resting so I did. Freaky since my dad explains the same boy sometimes appears around him, supposedly haunted him for a while. Reminding him of his child self. Idk idk, freaky</p>

Okay, so my mom believes in that &quot;bad juju&quot; stuff. She sages and shit. She also tends to not sleep in her room sometimes because of the fact that she never sleeps good in there and she sometimes has nightmares. One night I slept in my moms room because my dog pissed on my bed at like 10pm and I remember tiny little things about this certain dream and i rarely remember my dreams all together. I only remember the end of this dream because this tall, black figure was behind me in this dream and when I turned to look at it, it grabbed me I guess and that caused me to wake up because this bad vibrating feeling shot up my back all the way to my shoulders and I was out of breathe for a few seconds. I really think something&#39;s wrong with me because it wasn&#39;t the first time a dark figure has scared me in some way.</p>

The barracks we were staying in were 3 long hallways that formed a U. We slept four to a room, and had to keep our door open all night. 
 I got woken up in the middle of the night, by what sounded like somebody being strangled and desperately trying to  scream for help. The scream was broken, wet and raspy.
I bolted out of bed and realised the scream was coming from one of my three roommates, who had a bad case of laryngitis. She was sitting straight up in her bed pointing at the door with wide, terror filled eyes, and was just screaming.
 I looked at the door and saw a headless figure in our doorway, only illuminated by the red glow of the exit sign just outside our door. The figures shoulders were almost at the top of the door frame and it was floating about two feet off the ground. Gently swaying and turning in the night breeze.
My first thought was that somebody had hung themselves from our door frame, and I was looking at their swaying body. I reach for a flashlight and started screaming for help.</p>

<p>It turns out one of my roommates had left her Locker Unlocked, and our instructor decided it would be funny to take one of her coveralls, stuff it full of her other clothes and hang it in our doorway.</p>

It was about one or two in the morning. Now our dorm room is at the side of the building closest to the parking lot, with a little dead end road right next to the wall my bed is against. So we&#39;re sleeping, and all of a sudden we hear this loud rumbling, slowly getting louder. I kid you not, this sounds like a freight train rumbling past. The walls start to shake, our beds our shaking, it wakes up both up. We both have anxiety so our hearts are racing as the sound eventually quietly down to a less intense rumbling.
We&#39;re sitting in bed, terrified and wondering what in the world just happened. Through the blinds of my window, I can see two white lights, like eyes. So slowly, still scared, I get up and peek out the window. It was snowing softly, as it had been since the night before, but there was maybe three inches of snow on the ground. 
Turns out, the school had decided to hire a CAT excavator as a snow plow for this tiny bit of snow, and plow the parking lots at 2 in the morning! We were so mad the rest of the day.
Dont know how scary that is, but it terrified us.</p>

So when I finally woke up, I looked over to see no one there. I looked on the floor thinking he lied down to scare me but there was no one there. Then I heard a “hey” from behind me on the right side of the bed so I crawled over to also see no one there. Then I heard someone call my name from the left side and I turned around quick enough to see a head dip down. I slowly crawled over and two feet going under my bed. I got up and looked under to see no one there. I searched my whole room and found no one. I then went to my brothers room to see him sleeping like a rock.

 When I was around the age of 3, my mom had decorated me a “big girl room” so that I would maybe stop sleeping in her bed and be a big girl and sleep in a big girls bed. Well, at first I loved my room, I would run upstairs to my room each afternoon after daycare and play with my dolls and stuffed animals while mom fixed dinner and for a little while playing alone upstairs and sleeping in my big girl bed was going great. Well one day, mom brought me home from school and I ran upstairs to play, as usual, but my mom noticed something weird when she came to check on me. She said that as she approached my bedroom door, my back was facing her and I was just talking to myself (and to my toys) and I was mid sentence when I stopped, lifted my head and turned and looked at her with a straight face. She then asked who I was talking to in which I replied with “My friend, Tommy.” She then said “Okay.” And went to walk away and my door slammed right behind her and I came running out as white as a ghost and asked her “Mommy, why would Tommy slam the door?” Now that freaked my mom out and she made me start playing down stairs and I’m not going to lie I was scared to go to sleep in there that night so my mom reassured me that everything was fine and she tucked me in, checked the closet and under the bed for “monsters” and asked me which stuffed animal I wanted to sleep with to which I said “all of them” and I also asked for every single light in my room to stay on while I was asleep and my mom agreed to allow me to do so. Well right beside my bed there was an old desk that was my grandfathers when he was younger and a few hours after falling asleep I woke up hearing a child laughing and as I rolled over to look around, the drawers in the desk flew open and all of the lights in my room turned off. I screamed and my mom ran upstairs and from that day until we left that house, I never slept in that room again and I was never allowed to go in there.</p>

<p>Two years later at camp the person I texted was playing ping pong with this new kid, Logan. After the first round I realized...he was left-handed. So I said, &quot;Hey XYZ, did you notice Logan is left-handed?&quot; XYZ turns and stares at him. Logan asks me why it matters. </p>

<p>I jumped up at around 2:53 AM to the sound of a weather emergency alert. The loud beeping literally is the scariest sound in the world to me, it’s a feeling of “oh my god am I gonna die” mixed with the fear of what is happening, just hearing the deafening noise you don’t even KNOW what’s happening. It sounded like it was coming from the other room, from like a phone or something. I immediately call out to my family, who I thought would also jump up to the noise. (My mom is a very VERY light sleeper (wakes up to even just the sound of footsteps)) I literally said out loud “What was that? Does anyone know where that’s coming from?” No answer, complete silence. The sound stopped a few seconds later. I of course, start shaking, and attempt to make my way down the hall. My mom, dead asleep gets up to the sound of me walking in the room. I asked her if she heard the noise, she had no clue what I was talking about. She had to sit with me and calm me down for like a half hour, but I didn’t fall asleep after that. (Yes I did cry, shut up) We checked all our phones for any alerts, nothing at all. I checked every website that keeps track of all emergency alerts, nothing at all in my area. My mom thought I was just dreaming, or still hearing my dream (?) while still being awake, or going insane. But I distinctly heard it, even at least 20 seconds after I woke up. We still don’t know what that was to this day, I couldn’t find anything on the internet similar to it. The thought of the blaring alarm still terrifies me-</p>

<p>I also woke up to knocking on my wall, (edit: this was a different time) I said “Be quiet please, I’m trying to sleep.” The knocking stopped. I said thanks and tried to go back to sleep, but to be honest while it was weird, it’s still a pretty basic story-</p>

<p>Edit: overall, dang these aren’t even all my stories, not sure what’s wrong with me at this point to be honest-</p>

This happened when I was 7 or 8. </p>

<p>I woke up at about 3 in the morning, I had to piss reeeaaal bad, so I went to the bathroom. While I was going to the bathroom I heard an incredibly loud bang, I thought it was a gunshot, my bathroom was in my room and I was planning to run and hide under my covers, but when I passed one of the windows in my bedroom I noticed some strange lights outside, almost every police officer from our police department was there, and since there was so many, it confirmed my suspicion, I thought that “gunshot” was aimed towards my stepsister since the sound was so close. I thought my stepsister was dead. While I saw it all, I don’t know how, but I saw my aunt, I don’t know if it was a random image that my mind was making up or a ghost. I don’t believe strongly in ghosts but I still do believe. So that was a completely different thing they absolutely terrified me. After the image of my aunt disappeared, and I was hiding what I thought was safely under my covers, when I heard another incredibly loud boom, the officers outside broke into my house, but I thought it was a murderer or some terrible criminal breaking into my house, but when one of the officers ran up the stairs and into my room telling me to get out because my house was on fire, well, I got out. But when I was leaving my room, I noticed that the bathroom in the hallway was completely covered in flames. The loud sound I had heard was the third floor of the house caving into the bathroom. The way the bathroom was there was the room with the sink and the room with the toilet and shower/bath. And the room with the sink was the room that the third floor caved in on. So if i didn’t have a bathroom in my room, then I would’ve gotten trapped in the other bathroom, engulfed in flames, most likely ya know, fucking dying. It was mid November so here in Oklahoma it was freezing and my dumbass ran into the house to get my sliides Bc the ground was so cold. When I was in there, I could’ve sworn I saw my aunt again. We learned the next morning that my aunt had committed suicide. And we also learned that only about five seconds after I left my room, the part of the third floor above my room collapsed as well because the roof had fallen on it. Two close calls with death there.

 I was dreaming that I was walking around on the 10th floor of a building, one of those types with stairwells that wind around in squares, where you can look down the center and see all the way to the bottom. I was in the stairwell, looking down, when a voice behind me said, &quot;Looks far, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Then, I felt a push from behind and tumbled headlong down the center of the stairwell. It felt like I was going slowly at first, but I sped up as I fell, rushing towards the bottom. I cried out as I got closer to the end of my life in the dream, screaming, &quot;STOP!!&quot; Then, as I hit the floor, I woke up and bolted upright in bed, my heart pounding, my sheets soaked. I thought, oh, it was just a dream. As I closed my eyes, I heard my father from the doorway to my room say to me, &quot;It was just a dream, son. Go back to sleep.&quot; I mumbled my consent, then moments later bolted back upright, scared to death at what I had just heard.<br/>
My dad died in Iran, during the war on ISIS...<br/>

But at one moment I woke up I looked at a part of my wall that came of out the rest. I usually stare at it but when I looked at it this time I immediately froze. She was horrifying, It looked like a Little girl in a torn Victorian nightgown. She had extremely ratty hair, No face. It looked as if a cannonball went into her face, But I could see her rotting flesh in her face. I never believed in ghosts before, Yet that convinced me. I could move but I felt if I did she&#39;d know I was there and i&#39;d be possessed. It was Scary to Even close my Eyes. The next night as soon as I went to bed my eyes were shut tight, I can&#39;t remember much from what she said, But I know someone killed her at the Forest Preserve next to me, and that her name was Evelyn.</p>

<p>Edit: I just showed my mom this and apparently in this house she had heard someone walking up and down the stairs when no one was home but her, And the people who lived here before saw people (not ones that live in the house once again ghosts as we agree) and voices that they didn&#39;t recognize. . .Probably because this house was originally built in the 1920&#39;s.</p>

I was very close to Sadie as she had been such a smart and helpful dog, she was even the one who taught me to walk. I would crawl to her and she would stop and wait for me to pull on her to stand up and she would slowly walk so I could keep up. After she died, everyone was devastated. Along with me being upset Sadie wasn&#39;t around anymore, I was also terrified every night. For about a year I would go to sleep and have nightmares about Sadie coming back from the bed with blood red eyes and in each nightmare she would continue to maul me in different locations, then I would wake up screaming and my parents would come in and comfort me. Once I cal.ed down, I would try to go back to bed, but it always took me what felt like an hour or two. I would try to keep my eyes closed and hope I would fall asleep, but each night I would open my eyes again and Sadie would be sitting right in the middle of my floor, staring at me. I would slowly move to the edge of my bed to turn on my light and her head would turn with my movement. Everytime I turned on the light she dissapeared, so I would turn it back off and lay down. When I would lay down she&#39;d be right back to where she was before, so I just pulled my blanket over my head and try to sleep.</p>

<p>I woke up, and I wasn&#39;t able to move, I felt something physically crouching on my back; it seemed as if it could have been a cat, but my window was too high for one to get in, and the family cat had died the year before.</p>

<p>it leaned in close to my ear, and started muttering gibberish at me. there were some regular words mixed in, but I couldn&#39;t understand most of it. I felt its claws digging into my back, I felt its little hands gripping my shoulders. It seemed desperate to tell me something, but I only felt pure terror. we stayed that way for maybe 20 minutes, it never stopping its whispering before i was able to actually fall back asleep.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve moved rooms since then, but sometimes i still feel a cat sized cold spot pressed against my leg or abdomen when I&#39;m falling asleep- I can tell it&#39;s definitely not either of my current cats, because they would be warm. I&#39;ve also been finding un-explainable scratch marks on my legs and stomach since then, as well as the usual ghost-y haunted house stuff; cold spots, whispering, dog barking at nothing. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t had a paralysis episode since then (I&#39;m 18 now) but I do think what ever this creature is, it likes me.</p>

<p>But once i heard a noise that sounded like sandpaper on the wall, so i went to check and what i saw horrified me. I saw a man in all black with a white plastic mask standing in my living room with a plastic bag full of my stuff. The man was physically shorter than me so he got scared and ran out my door. he had picked the lock on my door.</p>

<p>I had to change all of the locks on my door and try to make them pick-resistan via locksmith. He had stolen my spare house keys, my laptop, my nintendo switch, and what little jewlery i had.

Is it creepy? Eh, to me it was.</p>

<p>So, more than 10 years ago, I remember I used to sleep in parent&#39;s bed sometimes. My mother always had this creepy looking doll, it looked as if it was a mash-up of a Jester and a Princess of sorts. Multiple times, I&#39;d wake up in the middle of the night, and just stare at it. I was always facing it&#39;s left side, but I swear it would always turn its head in my direction when I watched it, so it&#39;d watch me back.</p>

<p>Other than that, I only have one other startling moment that I woke up to. I remember that I had a dream (I won&#39;t go too much into detail, but I&#39;ll go into what I can), and... I was battling Azula from Avatar (I was like 6 or 7, give me a break XD), and I rememeber her suddenly reaching out both her hands, as to deliver a final blow to my back, fire ready and all, and then I woke up. However, I could still feel the two hands on my back, I didn&#39;t dare open my eyes or even move. The hands lifted up, and I didn&#39;t hear anything. Not my door, nothing. I got up and checked the hallway, but I saw nothing in the dark, and both my parents were asleep...</p>

<p>(In short I had trouble going back to sleep.)</p>

I watched ET as a kid (around 4-5 years old) and ever since then I have been terrified to the point that I STILL (27 years old) have nightmares of him.</p>

<p>This starts out with a nightmare I had before I woke up. In my nightmare I wake up to scratching noises at my window. I shared a room with my little sister and she had the bottom bunk and I had the top bunk (I was about 9 and she was about 4) so I climbed down the ladder and moved the curtains and saw nothing. I closed the curtains and climbed back to my bed and as soon as I closed my eyes, I heard more noises at the window but it sounded like someone strumming their fingers against it. Again, I climbed down the bunk bed and looked out the window and saw nothing. I turned to go back to the bed but a red glow illuminated the room. I froze and heard something smash up against the window and I turned and came face to face with an alien. </p>

<p>This caused me to ACTUALLY wake up. I bolted upright and nearly smashed my face into the ceiling. After about 5 minutes I calmed myself down enough to lay back down. I was so distraught that I woke up my little sister so we talked for a few minutes before we both decided to go back to sleep. About 10 minutes into us trying to fall back asleep we both heard a scratch at the window and the leaves underneath it rustle. We both panicked and screamed for our mom. She came in and we were both crying that something was outside the window but when she pulled the curtain back she saw nothing. We both ended up sleeping with her and my dad that night. </p>

<p>Thinking back on it now, I believe it was one of our cats. In the middle of the night they would meow at the windows to wake us up to let them back it. But who knows.</p>

Sometimes I would wake up hearing people outside my window (I&#39;m on the second floor about 12 feet up ) and I would look outside the window and nobody would by there. I live in an area where houses aren&#39;t close together. One night when I woke up I could not stay in my room. If i tried i would start crying so i slept outside of my room. Apparently my house is built on a mass path going to an old church in my area and a lot of unusual things happen here. Most of the people in my family have had some sort of paranormal experience.</p>

I had just gotten out of bed and was heading to the bathroom that was adjacent to the bedroom I shared with my siblings. I made it about a foot past the doorway when I heard the floorboards start creaking. I looked up to see a very tall african american man in a civil war era army uniform walk all the way down the hall and to the den and disappear after reaching the railing. I remember it so vividly. Hell, I&#39;m sure I could draw every detail of his face and clothing. He smelled like dirt and burned wood. I felt the air from his movement on my face. Needless to say, I held my business in until morning. And after I told my parents, we did some research on the land and we discovered that there was a minor battle that took place there during the Civil War which involved an African American regime. Just thinking about that experience I had gives me so much anxiety.</p>

<p>So my childhood apartment is a small and old one. My parents still live in it and this one week i was over visiting them (i slept in my old bedroom) , after i had finally fallen asleep i woke up because of some strange tapping noise coming from across the room. When i finally sat up on my bed to look where the noise came from, i noticed that it was coming from my old table, it sounded like a fingernail hitting the wood. At first i thought that maybe something was leaking, but then quickly remembered that we were on the top floor, and the bedroom didnt have any sort of air conditioning. In fear i had listened to the tapping until it stopped, sitting as close as i could to the walls of the bedroom, still on the bed.
After the tapping stopped i quietly asked out loud &quot;is anyone here?&quot; and then proceeded to add that one tap for yes, and two for no.
I heard one tap. And after that my &quot;interview&quot; began. 
i started to ask questions, mostly guessing what was causing the tapping. But once i let the back and forth set in, i asked questions targeted at me, the last question was:</p>

<p>&quot;am i going to die soon?&quot;</p>

<p>I didnt get an answer.</p>

<p>Scared, i took my pillow and sneaked into the living room, not wanting to stay in that room anymore. I layed on the couch and waited, it took an hour before my lack of sleep caught up and i was slowly fading into a dream. But right i could get my peace, i heard the quietest tap coming down the halls.</p>

<p>(a true story that still haunts me to this day, i no longer sleep in that bedroom :) and just to reassure myself, the next day i did check the ceiling for leaking thinking that maybe rain had caused it, but everything was dry.)</p>

I was too young to understand how bad that was for her, but she really suffered. When I turned 17 I started to have this really vivid dreams, witch to this day I can&#39;t quite explain. So, one night, I had one of those dreams. I was in a black room and there was a boy. He seemed a little older than my brother (he is 11 years old now), he had curly hair and was wearing a red t-shirt (they were very much a like). I gently started to get near him. I remember asking him if everything was ok, and if he  was enjoying the place he was. He didn&#39;t answer, so I got really near and touched is shouder. I wake up and when I look to my left, he was standing there, with the same look in his eyes (like he knows something that I don&#39;t) and vanishes. I didn&#39;t got scared, surpriseling I felt this calm sensation, and slept again. I told my mother about it, and she started crying. She didn&#39;t know what to say, but she said she was happy. I still have strange dreams, and they don&#39;t scare me at all.</p>

Went camping and our campsite was next to the bathroom and showers. It was confident because I needed to use the bathroom. I’m Tran man but I use the women’s because I sit to pee and it was the closet to us. So I park run in and come back. Well I was in the bathroom apparently something that looked like me came out of the men’s restroom and told everyone in the group “the men’s bathroom had no stall doors. I’m not joking” they were also smiling unnaturally large and looked exactly like me. Once everyone had been confused they person went back into the men’s bathroom because they said “I still have to pee but I wanted to warn everyone.” I was unaware of this till we were leaving. Later that night a raccoon was feet from out camp table and I just looked at it and it started to stand on his hind legs looking at me and walking closer. I said in a loud voice that the raccoons walking over here. And a friend got up to come over and scared the raccoon  and it running back to a bush. I followed it to scare them from trying again but I couldn’t see them any longer like it had disappeared as it entered the bushes. As we left Someone In the car said to me “so I went into the men’s restroom and they had doors?? Why’d you say there weren’t doors?”  And I told them “I don’t use the men bathroom??” And that’s when they told me about the first entity and now we believe I’ve been followed all weekend by something and was messing with us well we were camping.... to this day I have strange things happen or things move or go missing.</p>

Here is mine:
When I was around three of four I was sleeping at my bio fathers house (he had us on weekends). My twin sister and I shared a full size bed at the time and since she would fall of the bed a lot I usually slept on the outside while she got the wall. Well that night I was the one to fall off the bed. Rolled right off. I have no clue how but when I landed on the floor something went right through my chin. Not the front of my chin. This wasn&#39;t a case of biting through my lip or busting my chin open. No. Some unknown object went straight through the underside of my jaw, right under the tongue. We never found out what it was and now 23 years later I still have a smooth scar there. I did have to go to the hospital since it would not stop bleeding. 
With a related incident later that year that involved me walking into the &quot;play room&quot; at my grandmother&#39;s house ( I walked out of the room with a scratch that extended from my knee to my ankle that was bleeding heavily, but I hadn&#39;t felt in happen and we couldn&#39;t find what did it) - I was completely convinced that the monster that lived in my grandmother&#39;s basement was following me from house to house and sticking its&#39; long claw through the floor to catch me. </p>

<p>TL:DR I fell off a bed and got stabbed through the jaw when I was 3-4 by an unknown object. I was convinced for years that it was a monster.</p>

I believe that the year was 2012 or 2011. It was a movie night and th house that my mom currently has was up on top of a ship on mainstreet in Wisconsin. My mom and older stepbrother wanted to watch insidious, but at the Time I was to scared of horror movies so they sent me to bed. The house was small only having two bed rooms so my younger brother fell asleep in my parents bed while I slept in his and my youngest slept in his own cause he was only 4ish. Well I was having issues falling asleep cause of the creams coming from the tv, so I started to look around and take in every detail ( something that happens when I get nervous or bored). And I look through the door frame that leads in to my mom and stepdads room and I see a figure which was holding some type of weapon. I was frozen with fear and I didn’t know what to do j had thought that someone broke into the shop downstairs or something. As soon as I could move I sprinted outside where my parents and aunt were and told my mom what I saw. She said it was just a figment of my imagination and sent me back inside. When I made it back to the bed the figure was gone. I didn’t sleep that night cause I was scared and wanted to make sure no one walked out of the shop downstairs.</p>

So when i was about 10 i woke up in the middle of the night and had to use the restroom which was in my basement and i was in the attic. And the whole time i was walking down i was hearing a very small crying sound. I dident care much so i just went downstairs. Then when I hit the last step and turned the corner. I saw a baby car seat facing away from me. As i went closer the crying became louder. And I said &quot;it&#39;s ok&quot; in a comforting voice and it stopped. Then i checked out the car seat and there was nothing there. </p>

<p>Im kinda proud of myself because i felt like i comforted my little brother before he went to heaven. 😁</p>

One night, a few years ago, I could&#39;nt seem to fall asleep. I thought that since i were awake, I&#39;d go downstairs to get a drink and use the bathroom. I left the bathroom and immediately I could&#39;nt see, I had adjusted my eyesight to the lights in the bathroom and all seemed to be pitch black without it. I had to carefully walk to my room and I had to inch my way there. I had finally gotten to the door, but I couldnt tell where the handle was so I reached out. As soon as I had reached out, I felt something with a silk-like texture with a hint of fur. I quickly took my hand away and saw a bat as it flew around my house after I had awoken it.</p>

One of those nights I woke up and decided to look into the window and i saw the shadow of a child,I remember that it was a boy and it had a bowl cut. I was scared, but I turned around and want back to sleep. I don&#39;t know how much time passed but after seeing that, but I woke up to the sound of my mother praying in her sleep, my father and I woke up and woke my mom up too as fast as we could cuz we knew she was having a nightmare. she said that in her dream she saw someone staring at her and in her dream, so she stared to pray. I have to say that I didn&#39;t sleep well that night...
And remember the child I saw? Once my mom woke up the shadow was gone too...

The first one happend more then once, from the time I was about 6 to about 8 almost everytime I was in bed trying to sleep and I would look att my door I would see a bright blue figure slowly walking to my bed, they would stop at my feet and slowly turn to look at me. Everytime I blinked it got back to my door and started walking to me, so one time I tried to keep my eyes open to see what they wanted. It got to my feet and slowly started to reach for my face, it was almost touching my face when I blinked and it was back at my door, I always closed my eyes as soon as I laid down after that because I did not want to know what would happen if it touched me.</p>

<p>My second scary story only happend twice, I think I was 13 or 14, I had a dream that I could not move and a big black dot was in front of me slowly moving away, nothing really happend in that dream, but when I woke up my depth perception was of. I was no longer in my bed one meter of the floor but 30 meter from the floor and almost couldnt see it. It was like that the whole day, everything was really far away and I had trouble seeing were everything were and all sound was muted, like I was under water. Everytime someone talked it was as if I were under water and someone on the surface was talking. I felt so alone the whole day, like I was the only one in the whole world, or like everyone avoided me.</p>

I remember going to bed and after having a weird dream. At some point during the night i &quot;woke up&quot; to a loud bang sound, almost like a gunshot. I was near the edge of my bed and looking towards the floor, as i was trying to figure out what that loud sound was i notice something small rolling slowly from under my bed. It was a child&#39;s head, it looked at me, opened it&#39;s mouth and screamed louder than the loud bang sound. While it was screaming the face began to rot until it was an eyeless zombie like face. Then i really woke up in my bed and i couldn&#39;t move. I felt pressure all over my body and could feel something behind me. I work security at a juvenile prison and have been in numerous riots but at that moment every cell in my body was screaming that if i turn to look at what was behind me, i was going to be killed. After a few minutes i was able to slowly move again and I felt the presence leave but i thought i was going to be killed that night.</p>

Everything was fine for a while, just me and my dog hanging out, until suddenly my dog stood up abruptly and stared at the back door, growling very quietly. I&#39;d never seen her react like that, so I got pretty nervous and peeked around the corner to look and see what she was looking at. The back door light was on, so I could see some kind of shadow through the window, but couldn&#39;t exactly make out what it was. I don&#39;t know if it was just from the angle of the light or something, but the shadow looked too big to be human. Winter (my dog) and I stood at the top of the stairs staring at the thing, when the door handle stared moving. Thank god the door was locked, cause the thing tried for a good two minutes to open the door, unsuccessful in the end. I was too scared to do anything else at the time, so I slowly walked over to the sliding door where I usually let Winter outside. She stuck right beside me the entire time, but the second I even cracked the sliding door, she bolted outside barking and growling wildly at whatever was in the backyard. Thankfully she chased it off, but I was still kinda sketched out so I went outside to look around. I think the thing that made the entire situation scary was the fact that when I went outside, the only tracks in the snow were from me and my dog, nothing else. Super scary, now I make sure all the doors in the house are locked and the outside lights are on before I go to bed.</p>

When I was a child up until I was about six or so years old almost every night I would see the same thing. Down the hallway outside my room I would see shadow figures of various persons, but more specifically and most terrifyingly I would always see a little girl who looked exactly like me crawling towards me on the floor to my room. All I could do was hide under my blanket. It wasn’t until we moved that I stopped seeing her, and I still swear that it was Melody to this day.</p>

Anyway I would  come over to stay the night every once in awhile, he was a good friend despite being very  weird, but this time i had came over to see how he was, as his grandmother had just recently died of cancer, it was c un hangout we played video games and ran around had nerf wars. But, later that night when we had gone to bed, his room is in the basement,  I was laying on the floor with some blankets. I had suddenly woken up bolting into a sitting position, he heart racing. Standing or rather floating a few feet in front of me was a glowing humanoid shape, at first I couldn&#39;t tell who it was but as my eyes adjusted to the light I could make out his grandmother in a hospital gown just staring at him, she slowly turned towards me, we locked eyes, i felt pure hatred directed at me, then the world went black. I woke up the next morning and told my friend that I had seen his grandmother, he said he had seen her before, he looked happy knowing that she was with him, so I never told him of how she looked at me. I only saw her once and I haven&#39;t forgotten, I probably never will.</p>

I had my own bedroom in the house, right across from my Dad&#39;s. </p>

<p>The room had its own short hallway you had to walk through before it opened up to a desk, a dresser with a mirror on top, two twin bed, and then all the way at the back of the room in between the beds was a nightstand with a lamp. That was the only light in the room, and if it was dark you had to walk all the way in and turn it on. It wouldn&#39;t turn on at nighttime. It worked fine during the day, and would turn off it you wanted it to, but not on at night.</p>

<p>I started waking up in the middle of the night, a strange new habit that only happened weekends I stayed at his house. When my sisters and I were alone we would all stay in the living room together, and try not to go to any other rooms. </p>

<p>Then one night everything changed. I woke up at 2:57 am. I sat up and waited for my eyes to adjust as I realized my dad had turned my light off. When I could finally see through the darkness I realized there was a shadow standing at next to my dresser, a few feet away from foot of my bed. He was at least a foot taller than my father, with glowing red eyes. I could tell he was angry. I was so scared I couldn&#39;t move. I felt like if I looked away it would be the last thing I did. I quickly glanced over to the mirror and realized that he had no reflection. I tried pulling the blanket over my head, as soon as I did I heard footsteps, and when I yanked it down he was closer. He disappeared around 4:30am. </p>

<p>The next night I had the light on when I fell asleep, when I woke up it was off. I didn&#39;t try to pull the blanket over my head, just stared at him. When I once tried to say something, he growled at me.</p>

<p>Aftee about a week the 3 of us started only sleeping in the living room, as we would get chills, doors would slam, and we would feel watched around the house.</p>

<p>He moved out after only 6 months because he said it didn&#39;t feel right. </p>

<p>In 8th grade I was reading a book about ghosts in my hometown and learned that there is a way that spirits manifest as &quot;shadow people&quot;. They fit what I saw perfectly. They were known for appearing in certain areas of my town, and had been caught on film at the cemetery that was a few miles away from his house.</p>

The first one isn&#39;t something I necessarily woke up to but it was something that happened when I woke up in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>When I was only 5 or 6 years old I had woken up in a cold sweat from a terrible nightmare although I don&#39;t remember anything about it. I knew it scared me enough for me to move into the hall and start walking over to my grandma&#39;s room though. I opened her door about to tell her that I had a bad nightmare and wanted to sleep with her that night, but before I could even get my hand off the knob I looked forward and saw my grandma standing in front of the door as if she was just waiting there for me. Her eyes were rolled back in her head and before anything else could happen I jumped what seemed like 5 feet in the air to me and let out a gasp before slamming the door shut and running back to my room, slamming my door and running to my bed covering my face with the sheets. About 30 minutes later I got out of bed and reluctantly walked to her room with the closest thing I had to a weapon-a tv remote-and when I opened her door and peeked inside, she was fast asleep in her bed as if nothing ever happened. I somehow found it in me to fall asleep once I got back to my room.</p>

<p>As for my second story, when I was 12 I was asleep in my room when I woke from a nightmare, nothing too bad as I had been having nightmares for the past few days, but because of that I had been leaving my light on at night when I went to sleep along with my tv. So what scared me when I woke up from my nightmare was that the tv was off along with my fan light, making the room pitch black. Not a second later I felt a hand on my head and I froze. I couldn&#39;t move for a good 5 seconds while the hand stroked my head. When I heard a voice go &quot;shhhh&quot; as if it was trying to calm a frightened child, which I was, I jumped up and ran to the light switch, flipping it on, and when I did I turned back violently to look at the spot next to my bed where the voice had come from. No trace of a person being there or leaving. Everything was in place and I didn&#39;t hear a sound except my own heaving and heavy footsteps when I ran to the light switch. I checked my entire room and couldn&#39;t find anything and was left with no explanation. Seeing as it was a Saturday night I waited till morning to go back to sleep as I couldn&#39;t fall back into it after that.</p>

My sister was on her computer with her headphones on and couldn’t hear anything outside her room. I was with my dog in my room watching YouTube or playing league of legends with my lights off. All of a sudden I hear six consecutive very loud and strong bangs on my door. I felt terrified and I hid my dog because he was quietly growling at the door too. It took me two min to get the courage to go up to the door and even turn on my light and then look outside of my door. All I saw was a ladder had fallen in the hallway but it wasn’t even leaning by my door I remember. And if it was a ladder falling how did it knock on my door and supposedly bounce six times each hitting harder than the last? I go check on my sister and she saw I was spooked and said she didn’t hear anything. I know she didn’t prank me or anything because she’s not the type to do that and she knows I’m already hyper aware of that stuff and she is too. To this day I’m afraid I summoned a demon or something evil by watching paranormal videos.</p>

I wanted to escape, and the only way was to satiate its hunger, in the dream I started sawing my own arm off, the goo ate it and I woke up. But the real issue was that when I woke up I couldn&#39;t feel my arm. I looked up and in the corner of the room was the same goo, in real life. I don&#39;t what happened past that, I guess I must have hid in my bed and fell asleep but I think it may have been some kind of sleep paralysis thing. Never seen the goo since but still scary as hell thinking about how I could lose my arm again in real life</p>

I woke up after a bad nightmare, and like any child, I went to my parents for consolation. It was probably about two in the morning, so my parents were asleep and I have no siblings. The upstairs of my house is set up in an L shape, my room in the center with my parents’ room down the long end of the hallway and two other rooms across from mine down the shorter leg of the L. I walked out into the hallway and noticed a light was on in one of the rooms across from mine. I assumed it was my imagination, or that one of my parents forgot to turn the light off. But something was wrong - it was pure white and too bright to be a lightbulb. I froze, but decided I definitely needed to get my parents. Turning my back to the room, I continued down the hallway (trying to be as quiet as possible, as I wasn’t sure what was going on). About halfway down the hall to my parents’ room, I heard heavy footsteps and breathing (sounded like an adult man). I whipped around to see who it was, but no one was there and the footsteps/breathing were definitely getting closer. Sprinting into my parents’ room, I woke them up and explained what I saw. My dad took me out into the hallway. Nothing. Pitch black and no sound being made. I thought I was crazy; couldn’t sleep the rest of the night. Still not sure what I saw or heard.

<p>it was 10 pm and I haven&#39;t see that guy in at least 10 minutes but then I hear I scream of a women behind me.  I looked back and the men I saw was holding women on the floor. my first instinct was run and I run away from that place and got to home about 10:35 pm I tell my parents while I hug them. I never passed through that street again. </p>

<p>Edit:BTW it was a long street with a lake Infront. Also I was like around 12 and now I&#39;m 15</p>

<p>I&#39;m a very light sleeper, and when I used to live at my parents my room was at the end of the house, no one would bother that end of the house. </p>

<p>For some reason in the middle of the night I became acutely aware of my surroundings, hearing unusual creaks; a feeling that I wasn&#39;t the only one in my room. I tried to brush it off because I had school the next day. </p>

<p>An hour later I heard raspy breathing and again, felt very aware that there was a body in the room that wasn&#39;t mine. I open my eyes to blackness and turn my lamp on. I look around the room, there isn&#39;t anything that I can see that stands out. I put my glasses on and I look again. </p>

<p>I see feet at the end of the room - behind an old writing desk. </p>

<p>I f*cking panic. But my cat (lord and saviour) didn&#39;t seemed phased, so i got up and slowly walked over.</p>

<p>My sister, around 6, just sat in the corner, staring at the floor, breathing heavily. Our family is known for sleep walking, once I almost walked out from my window thinking it was a door but that&#39;s a story for another day. </p>

<p>I grabbed her arm, stood her up, and put her to bed. But I&#39;m sure this is the main root of my night terrors.</p>

I’m in the U.K btw </p>

<p>I was in the living room where I asked my parents to take my Yorkshire dog (coco) in my room. My room had a one window looking out beyond my back garden and my bunk bed (because I had an older brother) was next to window. It was getting dark so I decided to take coco down to her bed, suddenly she started barking at the window uncontrollably like something was their. I didn’t think of as much since she usually acted like this, but this was different. Anyway I took her downstairs and head for my bed at the top while my brother slept at the bottom and drifted of to sleep. For no real reason I was half awake at the middle of the night and their it was a dark shadow creature was standing by the window I thought nothing of it as I thought it was my brother who woke up for water so I went back to sleep. I woke up again probably 20 minutes later and it was still there just standing by the window, I took a good long look and realised it wasn’t him. It’s body was a dark black and was constantly pulsating like it’s body was made of maggots. It slowly turned to look at me with a gaze whitch I can only describe is like daggers then I saw it, it’s eyes were staring to glow a blood red I hid under the covers to wait out the storm and comprehend what I just saw my heart was racing with my body had a fight or flight reaction. I took another peak under the covers and it’s grotesque face was inches away from me with its blood shot eyes gazing into my soul I decided to sleep under the covers that night shaking from what I just experienced. I moved out of the house 3 years later.</p>

We rented out a cabin for the week and we were getting settled in. I hated renting out the cabins in the city we were in, I’ve never had good experience in them. I never did believe in the paranormal but every time we stayed in this city I would hear voices, see things and people that weren’t their. One night my parents left the cabin to go pick up my friend, I sat in the loft and watched a movie. I must have fell asleep but was awoken to a burning feeling. My arm felt like some stabbed it, I went downstairs to get Ice and bandages when I pulled up my sleeve I saw blood dripping down my arm. I keep calm a thought I scraped something in my sleep. I stopped the bleeding and went back to bed this time on the couch. I woke up to my mom screaming. I did realize they were back but I was to focused on why she was screaming. I jumped up but felt another burning pain this time on my back, I ran to the bathroom and jerked my hoodie off to see my back was covered in blood and deep scratch marks from my neck to my lower back. After I saw my back a ran to the living room to see the couch was covered in a small pool of blood.I passed out of pure fear. Woke up the next day at a hospital. I recovered fine but my parents took me to a psychic cause they new something did this to me and it wasn’t an intruder. I was only 11 so i didnt really understand why my parents were as worried about me as they were bug we were told that I had a connection with the entity that was in the cabin and it wanted me out. She said I needed to see if I was a psychic myself and if that’s what caused it. Years later i have never been back to that city. I still have experiences like voices, seeing figures, and whenever I go in a room lights start flickering. Sometimes I still ask myself if I really believe in the paranormal but that night was the worst out of all and convinced me.</p>

I live in a pretty old house, so naturally the stairs creek and shift a lot. Ever since I was very small I’ve been able to tell which of my family members was coming up or down the stairs just from the sound, as I’ve heard many people can do, because of the speed different people walk, and how weighty their steps are. But one night I heard someone charging down the stairs. My bedroom is right next to the stairs so it obviously woke me up. The sound was so clear, I could hear every footstep until the person reached the bottom of the stairs, even the shuffle of feet on carpet as they reached the bottom. I got up and opened my door to investigate, thinking something was wrong. I went to see who had got up before going downstairs, but found all of my family members asleep in their beds. I’ve always been a paranoid person so I was not about to go downstairs on my own so I rushed back into bed and didn’t open my door again until the next morning. I never told my family, but I do live in an area known for break-ins.</p>

Where the yard stopped there was a tree line with trees at least 4 stories tall. So when I was about six I woke up at like 3:00 a.m. I went to a window and looked at that tree line. I saw what looked like a big black blob. I thought it was just my mind moving that shadows around. But then I saw I huge figure almost as big as the trees stand up. I was just staring at it when it turned and looked at me. I went to a Corner and started crying. I woke up my parents and they ran to me. They asked what was wrong and I pointed to the window and it was gone. As I got older I thought my mind just was playing tricks on me. I never saw it again.</p>

I just got creepy vibes about it even while I’m typing I’m getting chills and nots in my stomach. One day my door to my room was closed not locked just closed. I heard someone outside my room and they were stomping LOUD and it woke me up. I could have thought it was my sister really needing to go to the bathroom but the person outside my room was panting. Didn’t sound like my sister until the door knob was starting to move then whatever was on the other side started to jiggle the door knob aggressively like my door was locked but it wasn’t. The person or thing stopped but whatever it was started knocking faintly. I just tried not to think about it and go back to sleep. But it was getting louder and louder and it stopped for the rest of the night. This night was creepy but that was just the begging. Around a year later the thing returned. This time I felt it open my door. I turned my head to it and found my door was opened a little bit. my door was also closed this night too, my door opened more and more as seconds went on. When the door was half way opened I saw a figure that was very very tall, dark, and skinny and it ran away as soon as I saw it. I got up and grabbed a pocket knife to defend myself and got to my door and nothing was there I went into my sisters room and saw nothing! I closed my door and locked it and put a chair on my door to block it. I never slept with my door unlocked again.(BTW my sister was not home on the second night because she was at collage so the second time was not her.)nothing like this has ever happened again but about every month I keep hearing a knock at my door.

<p>I was going to school there and had a really run-down apartment near the ocean (which was luxurious to have considering the area). It was a Saturday and I had no school the next day so I left my alarm clock off on my phone.  Suddenly, I was awoken by an awful alarm sound that really struck me as oddly disturbing. It was my phone and it was round about 7 in the morning. I went to look at it now wide awake by the sound it was making and it showed a text message that read: &quot;BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL&quot;.   </p>

<p>I immediately took action and grabbed my hiking bag with supplies in it and ran to my college&#39;s designated shelter, constantly checking up in the sky for a sign of anything (which was foolish since a missile comes in way too fast to really see it). Running to the shelter which was a few blocks away, I saw other students running, some crying, and others barely dodging getting run over in the streets because cars were flying to leave somewhere that probably wasn&#39;t safe anyway because you know, we are on a small island...But people aren&#39;t in their right mind when in a panic. Before I left, my landlord just sat in his chair and said: &quot;If I die, I die.&quot; He had already excepted his death so easily. This chaos ensued for 40 minutes, all the while I called my mother and messaged my friends giving them a final &quot;I love you&quot; just in case.   </p>

<p>Of course, as some of you reading this might already know, it was a mistake by an employee who pushed the wrong button to send off a real message to every phone in Hawaii. This of course was a huge sigh of relief, but I&#39;ll never forget those 40 minutes. Not many people can say they&#39;ve faced their death, and definitely not for 40 minutes. I often look back on that day as a reminder to myself that every day is a gift, and that when the time comes for me to die, I will not panic and will be able to accept my fate. That is a great thing to know about one&#39;s self, so in a way it was a gift. That being said, I&#39;ll never forget it.</p>

The first room was for kids as we entered you could see how the walls were covered in drawing looking as if they were done by 6 year olds they would’ve been cute if it wasn’t for the feeling we still had. So I took some photos there were toys and games the kids used to play with it was quite cute in away but as we were leaving my friend stopped dead in his track and asked if I had heard something I hadn’t so I just said it was probably the wind but he promised it sounded like a little girl giggling. We continued to the next room which was a therapist room and as we entered there was this flash of light but as soon as it came it was gone. Fucking terrifying. I take my photos and next we both hear just a cry it was a young lady she sound so sad and angry it’s a noise you can forget we quickly got out of the room. My friend decided to leave and wait in the car for me to be done with the building. Nothing else big happened some noise and light flickering noise the next building was the biggest of the three and let’s say me and him didn’t make it to the third building I am a firm believer in ghost and my friend wasn’t but after that night he will never doubt them again their were figure of kids running down the halls rocking chairs moving on their own screams and cries scariest shit ever now I can take a lot but I will never go back there again  and the photos were wiped from my card as if I had never taken them even though after every photo I looked at each and everyone but when I went home the card was empty</p>

My parents were out of town and my grandmother was watching my sister and I. I remember, after waking up in a cold sweat three times, thinking I was drowning, my grandmother told me to move from the chaise in the living room to my room so I could sleep more comfortably. I got in bed and went back to sleep. </p>

<p>About 30-40 minutes after closing my eyes, I felt this pressure super close to me and realized that my bed was sinking on the side as if someone had sat down. I thought it was my grandmother checking on me so I opened my eyes a little to see a lean figure with no face wrapped in blanket-like material. He didn’t move much and he made no noise. I began to speak to him and ended up conversing for about three hours. The whole time, he either stared at me or made fun of me (laughing without making any noise etc., even when we were talking he made no noise, I just somehow understood him) occasionally even helping me pull up my blanket or yanking it off of me. </p>

<p>Finally, I realized that my door was open and I got upset because I always sleep with the door closed and freaked out when it was open. That’s when I really woke up. I thanked my grandma for checking on me and asked her to close the door the next time and she said neither she or my sister had left the couch in the time since I left. When I went back to my room, “he” was gone.</p>

<p>I was a little shaken up about it and when my grandma actually came to check on me, she said that she’d heard me mumbling for three hours and assume I was just sleep talking.</p>

They were fast asleep. The voice was so familiar. Maybe because i heard it everyday, until the age of nine. I didn&#39;t get any sleep that night.</p>

Not just any kind of nightmare though, sometimes they come true. One time I had this dream where I had to find my sister, except it was very dark and very quiet and I could only here her whispers because if she spoke to loudly we would die a horrible death from this creature. It kinda looked like a monkey with these  weirdly shaped legs and arms and really long hair. I could tell because it was crawling surprisingly fast on the ceiling of whatever this place was and  I had to avoid it&#39;s hair as it draged behind.</p>

<p>This place looked some what familiar. It wasn&#39;t to dark to notice that. As soon as I approached of what seemed to be where my sister was, I heard the creature crawl towards me from behind. I quickly spun around only find nothing there....that&#39;s when I heard my sister whispered my name one last time. It sounded as if she was right next to me. I turned my head slightly to see that my sister was in fact that  monster.</p>

<p>That&#39;s when I woke up. Looked up around my dark room to only to realize that dream was in my room. More distorted and bigger though. Then I saw it. It was that thing again. It stood right next to my bed just.....watching me. I knew it had been there for a while because I didn&#39;t see nor here it come in. It wisperd my name once again....like it knew I was awake now despite how dark the room was to tell. I froze. Afraid of what it might do if I responded or moved in the slightest......</p>

<p>Then it somehow lost it&#39;s balance and fell. It turns out it was my sister. Her hair was very long and she it had down. She woke me up to ask me if I knew where her bunny plushie was because she couldn&#39;t sleep without it. It&#39;s really disturbing when my dreams are like that but  I have to live with it. It doesn&#39;t happen as much now though which is pretty good.</p>

For anyone who doesn’t know sleep paralysis is when you are about to go to sleep or just woken up from sleep and you can’t move or speak at all. Hallucinating is also common, especially after dreams. This is mostly common with people who have narcolepsy or sleep apnea, though I have neither. This incident was the first and only time I’ve ever had sleep paralysis and I hope to never experience something like this ever again. </p>

<p>I woke up in the middle of the night after an already pretty terrifying dream but I don’t remember what happened in the dream just what happened afterwards. I looked around my room at first trying to calm myself after the dream but I soon realized that I couldn’t move or speak. I’ve heard about sleep paralysis before and knew what was happening, but again never experienced something like this before so it was pretty terrifying. I started to look around my room and saw an abnormally tall figure standing in the corner of my room. I stared at it for a long time afraid to look away, but it didn’t move at all. Then I blinked and it was suddenly gone. I looked around my room just moving my eyes and then suddenly saw it standing just to the left of me right next to my bed. I could feel a scream in my throat but no sound came out. Even with the figure close it was still hard to make out details, the only thing I can distinctly remember along with his abnormal height was his long spindle like arms that then reached out for me. Just before he touched me my vision went completely dark, but I could still feel my eyes were open. I was blind. Suddenly all at once I felt hands all over me, some feeling like they were scratching my skin and some even going over my face. This only lasted for a few seconds however and then I was suddenly able to move, sitting straight up in my bed and turning on the light I looked around and nothing was there, now actually being awake.</p>

friend and when my ma asks about it i tell her that he had to move away. i think thats when they pieced together that my new friend was the old guy who was living under our house.</p>

<p>tldr: my schizophrenic brother hears someone living under the house my 3 year old self befriends the man living under the house and no one believes us. until the man plays one baseball broadcast just a little to loud.</p>

My grandparents had heard of some open land about 25 miles out from a nearby city. Turns out this land was an old Catholic college that was burned down by arsonists in the monks’ homes. My family and I got out and my grandfather, being cliche called out, “If anyone is hear, make yourself known.” There was no response, however when I looked up at the broken windows one was intact, and through it I saw a face. From the angle I was at it almost looked like the face was protruding through the window looking at us. My family got spooked and left in a hurry, everyone having seen something different. I have no idea what happened to that campus after that, I’m left only with the memories of those charred, crumbling buildings, and that face staring eerily into our eyes.</p>

<p>Edit: We figured out about the college’s history after seeing the remains, using google to look up what happened as we were there. I had no idea how to fit this in without killing the mood.</p>

After I watched two women run by, i noticed a creepy shape in the corner of my eye, who was sitting on my brother&#39;s bed who wasn&#39;t home that day and slowly started moving towards me. It had really long hair, so you could not look into it&#39;s face and had like 6 or 8 arms, looked a little like the dog girl monster from fullmetal alchemist just without the dog part. I felt uncomfortable again as I noticed that it moved, and In the blink of an eye it rushed crawling over my brother&#39;s bed and my chair right next to me, where it was only staring at me without making any noise at all I even could&#39;ve sworn I heard it breathing into my ear, really silently. At that point i had accepted my fate and thought about what i could do after i turned around, but in that brief moment I turned my head towards &quot;it&quot; it disappeard. It was simply gone, all of a sudden. After that strange event I just looked to my brothers bed expecting it to reappear as sudden as it left for about 1 1/2 hours. This kind of thing happened to me one more time after I came from basketball exercise on a late evening. I was heading into a street where there was a strange shaped tree right at the beginning of that corner. While I was heading into that street there was &quot;it&quot; with its incredibly long hair reaching the ground sitting in front of the tree and staring at me while it was sitting like a dog waiting for its owner at the door, and slowly turning its head my way as I was passing. The moment I noticed &quot;it&quot; I got scared so much, I kicked into its direction fearing something was about to jump at me and jumped in the air. After that I&#39;ve never seen &quot;it&quot; again</p>

I used to live in a really old house, about 100-150 years old at least, and if you know anything about older houses you know that the doors are very loud and clunky. So when I go to bed I close the door obviously, it&#39;s very loud so I know its closed, turn off the light (it&#39;s pitch black now). Later that same night I woke up and my parents were still not home and my door was WIDE open, not a little but all the way.</p>

<p>I know some might think &quot;oh it might have been the wind&quot;, there&#39;s no way wind could open these doors, when they close they&#39;re not opening without assistance.</p>

<p>The only two conclusions I can come up with are, 1:It was a heck&#39;in ghost, or 2:Someone broke into our house, but that last one makes no sense because I have two very little (and very annoying) dogs, they literally bark at the slightest movement.</p>

<p>One of the scariest things that has happend to me.</p>

Seeing that we discovered that a young boy had starved to death decades ago in the closet of the room my brother and I shared, it only made sense that weird shit happened. One of the most memorable incidents that I can vividly remember was when I came home from school one day. During this time, my brother and I had walked home from school. We would normally be home before our parents got home from work. So, we would be alone for a little over an hour before our parents returned. On one specific day, I had gotten home before my brother had. I was at the high school in our school district and he was at the middle school. Once I got home, I would normally hop in the shower and clean up after wrestling or football practice. I had gotten in the shower and been cleaning for a few minutes when I heard some odd thumping sounds coming from outside the bathroom door. The same pattern of thumps repeated over and over. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that somebody had been walking back and forth outside of the bathroom door while I was showering. This house was old and had wooden floors that made a lot of sound when people walked on them, so it wasn’t a mistaken sound of the house “settling”. These were very distinct footsteps, almost as though the person walking was stepping even harder than normal just so that I would hear them that much better. At this point, I thought it was my brother fucking with me, so I didn’t think much of it. However, I called out my brother’s name, like to say, “ha-ha, very funny”, only with no response. The footsteps continued back and forth for most of the duration of my shower. Once I finished showering and dried off, I stepped outside to see what in the hell my brother was doing. The only thing was, after looking around and calling out his name, I realized he was not home. I began to freak out a bit as I didn’t know how to explain the footsteps. Shortly after, my brother came walking through the front door, home from school. I have never been able to explain this event and it has stuck in my memory ever since. Again, after finding a few things out about the house and experiencing a fair amount of other unexplainable, seemingly paranormal events, I can only surmise that these footsteps were another one of these events.</p>

When I was about three I was going to bed with my cat as usual. When I fell asleep my cat ran out of my room as fast as they could. I was awoken by a little girl in a white dress with long, black hair that kept talking to me. I proceeded to go into my dads room and asked him to get the girl to be quiet so I could sleep because they wouldn’t stop talking to me.
Over the years that little girl has appeared a few more times. I am currently a teenager and the last time I saw her, she was also older. We are not in the same house as when I was 3 and yet she has still appeared.</p>

It made me jump, but I realized it was a hallucination. Spook #2 was muuuuch worse. I turned to look beside me and an the other side of the room was 2 figures. One was standing up in front of my closet with big scraggly hair and what looked like a full body cloak. The other was couched at and poking its head over the foot of the second bed in my room (which I have because my room used to be a generic children&#39;s room). They looked way more real than any other hallucinations I had, but I figured, and hoped, that&#39;s all they were. I closed my eyes and opened them again. Spook #3 was the fact that, unlike most of my half sleep hallucinations, they didn&#39;t go away after I opened my eyes again. Being the rational human I pretend to be, I turned on my lamp and they were gone. It took me about an hour to fall asleep, but I eventually. Now, I&#39;m 99% sure it was just another hallucination, but at the time I was thoroughly spooked.</p>

So I was staying at my aunt&#39;s house and yes I know this is pretty cliche but it was a stormy night and I was sleeping in one of the empty rooms. Then all of a sudden, I wake up to hear a baby crying. It was around 3 In the morning almost 4. The crying gets louder and louder. And at this point, I was getting annoyed and I thought it was the neighbor&#39;s kid crying because of the storm. So I tried to ignore it and go back to sleep. Then the crying sounded like it was right in front of my bed in the corner of the room. Then all of a sudden it gets quiet but a couple of seconds later, I hear a woman crying. I start panicking and eventually just put on my headphones and try to sleep. The next morning I tell my aunt what happened and she looked at me with this sad and worried look on her face. Then she told me that the room I was sleeping in was originally going to be her baby&#39;s room. But apparently the day she brought him home, that night, there was a storm and one of the windows wasn&#39;t shut correctly and a huge wave of just strong wind and rain slammed it open and I guess the wind was too strong because she said when she got to the room, the crib was knocked over and the baby was on the floor with the crib flipped over him. He was dead. She was sobbing and was screaming for her husband to call 911 but they weren&#39;t responsive. Her baby died in the room I was sleeping in and it would cry on rainy nights. And in the corner in front of my bed was where his crib was. I didn&#39;t believe her and was still convinced it was the neighbor&#39;s kid but then she told me that they didn&#39;t have a kid. I was probably like 11 at this time and I was still a little easily shaken. I&#39;m still not sure if this was really true but I haven&#39;t slept at her house for a while. Sure I visit but I haven&#39;t stayed a night. Her husband never talks about it and hates the mention of it. So I can&#39;t ask many people about it. My mom never told me about it because she didn&#39;t know much about it to begin with. So yeah that&#39;s one of my stories.</p>

My room doesn&#39;t have a lock to it and its pretty much kinda an attic and anyone can enter when they want to and it&#39;s fucking annoying. Well one of these time I woke up to my 17 year old brother staring down at me with his phone is his hand smiling at me (I&#39;m 15 and girl) he was talking to his girlfriend while doing this and I hate it. He apparently got scared and decided to come bother me because he thinks my 4 foot 11.5 ass could protect him. Bitch I can&#39;t protect his tall ass.</p>

<p>He&#39;s done this a few times all for different reasons. Sometimes it&#39;s at 3 am, 5, 6 am. Idk but it&#39;s always in the morning. He appeared in my room like 4 fucking days ago at 5 am to ask me if the internet was off. I had sensed him as soon as he opened the door and the door to my room is downstairs.</p>

A lot of creepy stuff has happened to me, never could explain any of it. One time I had woken up from a nap. It was about six pm and there was not much light left, which was strange because in the summer time it didn&#39;t get this dark until 7. It was an uneasy feeling I woke up to, and it was more quiet than usual, as my brother would usually be watching some youtube video down the hall. As I came to, there was a shadow by my feet next to my bed. It was looking at me. I thought it was just my brother who was going to ask me something, and happened to wake me up. I asked what he wanted quietly and weakly  as I was tired. He said nothing and just stood there. Now I was fully awake but still lying down, annoyed that I had gotten woken up. I asked what he wanted again but this time I was more loud. He still didn&#39;t respond. It was motionless. I didn&#39;t think it was my brother anymore. My mom was at the gym, and my dad was still at work, so at the moment I was just in my dark room with a darker shadow thing staring right at me only about 5 feet away from my face. When fear kicked in I swung my arm at it but it just went right through. A few seconds later it started to dissipate and light from the afternoon sun finally returned to my room. I got up and speed walked out of my room. I saw my brother laying down on the couch down the hall with headphones on. I sat in the other room with him for the rest of the afternoon glancing into the darkness of my room every so often, but always saw nothing. </p>

<p>I have had many other experiences with these shadow things. It not always when I wake up. It happened once when I was simply walking through my house, or sitting at my desk, but this is the closest I have ever gotten to one. I don&#39;t like to ponder on the experiences, they always freak me out.</p>

This being said when she picked the house my mom and dad wanted to start living in it was pretty creepy. The roof looked off and the building pretty old, so some paint was missing from the side. Also at the very top of the house were windows with bars on the doors. As a kid I didn&#39;t really know why, but it looks like something outta a horror movie. And unfortunately me and my brother got the last pick of the rooms which was that top floor. The attic, which was surprisingly roomy and easy fit two beds dressers and our tv on a plastic entertainment center.so after a few days of sleeping in the living room while my dad worked my step mom orders us to sleep up stairs.we obey fearing what wraith come our way being in our new room we had fun during the day exploring and playing me and my brother then discovered a door small like for a kid to crawl through also with a latch and Paint over it.peeling the paint we as young boys do wanted to see what was behind the door. Eventually we undo the launch to find an old box of books a dress and some carpeting. Saddened it wasn&#39;t a bridge to a magical world we closed it up and didn&#39;t put another thought into it. Sleeping the same night we starting hearing clawing and bumping around the room kinda scared we turned on our tv to see what it was.. nothing seemed outta place and the it stopped so as I went to turn off my tv my brother screamed, a shiver ran down my spine as I turned to realize the tv and the entertainment center moved away from the door the small door wide open, and a crow flying in bird flying in our room. My dad heard the commotion saw our fear and looked around seeing the bird he went down to get a shoe box to catch it but it and we went down stairs. A few moments past and we came up to see our father in disbelief, no bird no open windows cause there were none since the bars wouldn&#39;t let the windows open and the book we found in the door I&#39;m my brothers pillow. Still to this day didnt figure it out how it happen and when the door was closed and hatched locked with paint on it like we never went in. Probably never will. Anyway I love you mark you are the world to me all the you guys do fills me with hope and inspiration keep it out we love you.</p>

<p>What I saw standing by my door was a shadow of a person with red eyes and a bloody mouth. But it doesn&#39;t stop there. It bent all the back and was able to run/crawl all the way to my bed and it bit me in the arm and then disappeared. In the morning I saw the bite mark in my arm so I was going insane.

From my knees down I was ice cold. Then my door slowly creaked open as I heard a repeated hushed whisper loud enough for me to realize it was my name being whispered. I decided to stand up. Being only six, I did not know if it was my brother or something. Still the whisper of my name continued to sound. As I got closer, my legs got colder to the point I could not feel them. At this point I knew something was wrong. So I decided to turn back only being a few feet from my door. Then before i get into my bed, the door slams shut. Hearing the door slam made me freeze In my tracks. I turn to look, my legs still ice cold, and see a shadow in the corner. That&#39;s when I move quickly, jump in my bed, and hide under the blanket. I don&#39;t remember what happened after that, but I woke up late the next day. Everything was fine but the hallway was cold as every other room was room temperature. I decided to keep it to myself and didn&#39;t ever mention it.</p>

<p>So I i had woaken up and knew I was having SP, but it&#39;s still horrifying. (For refrence my room is basically a perfect cube) </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t notice it right away but there was something in the corner of my room, kinda sitting in the top corner diagonally across from my bed. It was this... thing, and it started moving across the ceiling towards me. I was panicking to say the least. It kept comming closer untill its &quot;face&quot; was hovering right above me.  I sat there with this things face no less than a foot above me for what seemed to be hours but was probably closer to 5-ish minutes. Then its body started to move again and it kinda bunched up like a snake dose. The last thing I rember before I fully woke up was it falling down on top of me. </p>

<p>I still have dreams about that thing, not a fun experience. 0/10 I do not recommend. </p>

<p>I draw the this I see in my dreams a lot and it was a fun thing trying to explain that... masterpiece ...to my art teacher.</p>

<p>Edit: just put up that sketch I was talking about on my profile.</p>

That night my dads appendix had bursted and he was taken to the hospital leaving me, my mom and my sister behind. My dad had left his phone downstairs on the counter in our house. So anyways that night my sister and I decided to sleep with my mom in her room because we were all tired and it had been a long day of fear for my dad. We then all fell asleep. Around 1 am we heard our car alarm outside go off, we all woke up from this and immediately thought “it must be a raccoon or some animal outside”, but the weird thing was our dog was repeatedly walking in a circle and barking which she had never done ever. When my mom took care of her car alarm beeping we all went back to bed thinking nothing of it. Around 3am we all woke up to the sound of someone stomping up our stairs very loudly. And then we heard it in our garage, we had no clue what the sound was, and when we looked over at our dog again and she was circling once again and barking at the noise. It didn’t sound like a animal, it sounded like a person. The noise finally stopped and we were all frightened by what happened so my mom put on the tv. Then my mom had gotten a notification on her phone, she checked it and her face said it all. The text message she got was from my dads phone that was down stairs on the counter. My dad has no way of reaching us since he was having surgery and was at the emergency room. The scariest part is the text message read “I’m here”. Me and my family still talk about this incident and are so confused by it still today.</p>

Here in Australia we had our Easter break extended to 3 weeks because of corona virus, so i had been staying up until quite late, sometimes until 3 o&#39;clock in the morning watching YouTube and Netflix. I knew this wasn&#39;t too good so i decided i should go to bed at 10:30 that night, so i did. But when i woke up, i couldn&#39;t move or even open my eyes, i&#39;m not sure if i could move but i didn&#39;t try because of what i felt climbing on top of my chest. i had woken up to a feeling as though someone was swinging there leg over my body, sitting on my chest and sniffing like a dog all across my face, but mostly in my left ear. this happens for about 10 seconds and then it just faded away. I quickly rolled over and grabbed my phone, it was 3:06 am, that alone kind of freaked me out because i had always heard that 3 am was the devils hour. I turned on my light and about 2 minutes later i heard footsteps coming down the hall to my door, and luckily it was my dad, he was wondering why i had my light on so i told him, he asked me if i had gone to get a drink or something, i asked why and he said that him and mum could hear a tap running in the house somewhere. I always hear strange sounds in the night, like the sound of footsteps and stuff, and sometimes we will wake up with a door open or something moved and we joke about how there is &quot;the ghost in the house&quot;. This has all only happend in our new house, this house isn&#39;t very old, it was built 10 years ago.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I know that this story sounds completely absurd but it happend. I assume that this was sleep paralysis, but i am still not completely sure because nothing like it has ever happend to me.</p>

Many years ago when I went camping with a group of friends we made reservations for a camping as a group at an old military base. The base was built in WW2 and was a battery installation and weapons depot on the west coast and it was supposedly haunted. Now here is the experience my friends and I decided to hike to the installation in the middle of the night and explore the base. The four of us decided to split and do stuff on are own. I decided to check out the old battery’s which connect to concrete structures and as I was minding my own business I Thought I saw one of my friends figure in the distance and hollered to get over to where I was at. Now figure is starting to look different as it gets closer and closer a more of a green and blue outline is approaching and to me looks like a soldier with a lantern. I start get freak out and run back to are campsite while I was running I hear gunshots I make it back and go to my tent. I wait in my tent until my friends get back and one go’s to my tent since we shared a tent and see’s that I’m freak out I tell him don’t go to the battery’s we need to leave right now. And so anyway I learned never to sleep at a old military base.
   P.s we got packed up once I calmed down </p>

<p>P.s.s the base is called fort Flagler</p>

<p>I wake up quite early these days, at around 4:30 AM, to play video games before anybody wakes up. My parents know about this but they think I do so to study early morning. The sun had not risen yet and It was so dark that I couldn&#39;t see my own hands. The would have to squint really hard if I turned on the lights, so I used my phone flashlight to go to the bathroom and brush my teeth, and then go to the kitchen to make breakfast. I had a dim blue portable night lamp in the kitchen, which I had turned on. I could just see enough to make breakfast. I was toasting some bread on the pan and making coffee. I didn&#39;t have a toaster. I was poured some hot water into my mug. I quickly went over to the stove to flip the slice of bread before it got burnt. I went back to pour some more water into my mug of coffee when I heard the loud ringing noise of my phone. I got startled and I spilled some water on the counter. My mother was calling me on my phone. she asked me to come to her bedroom. It is quite a walk down the hallway and up the stairs to her room.</p>

<p>I used the flashlight on my phone to light my path. I knocked at her door. No one answered. I knocked again, and after a few seconds, the door opened. She looked groggy and asked what happened. &quot;What? You called me asking me to come to your room&quot;, said I. She said that she didn&#39;t call me, closed the door and went back to sleep. I was wondering what happened. I was walking down the hallway checking the call history to see who called me. I was pretty sure it was my mother. As I was checking, from the corner of my eyes, I saw, instead of the dim blue light, there was a bright orange light coming from the kitchen. My heart raced. I rushed to the kitchen, with trembling feet. A cloth which was near the stove had caught fire, which in turn set the wooden overhead cabinet on fire.</p>

I can never forget this though. Cliche: I was about 6 at the time. I had woken up in the middle of the night to a little irritating ringing in one of my ears. I sat there in my bed just waiting for the ringing to stop. It stopped. I had opened my eyes again (FYI: My bed sits across the room from my door). For some reason my bed had been way closer to my door than usual. I was super confused (FYI again: sometimes when I&#39;m in a dark room and squint my eyes I get slight tunnel vision)  I had my eyes squinting bc I had still been half asleep. And I was looking around my room and there was this huge portal-like ball of light (the light was bright but nothing in the room reflected it). My heart started pounding, in a panic I had just stared at it and screaming for my mom for like 2 min until she came. She swung the door open asking me what was wrong. I had just instinctively told her,&quot;turn on the light. Turn on the light. Turn the light...&quot; like ten more times. She did, the ball of light was gone. She ran to me and calmed me down until I believed her words,&quot;IT MUST HAVE BEEN A NIGHTMARE&quot;. Nothing like this has happened since. Tell me what you think I should do about this. This happened years ago so I don&#39;t fear the situation, I just have a major fear of the dark now.</p>

<p>So one time I was babysitting my aunt and uncles 1-year-old kiddo. I was younger at the time and did not have a phone so my aunt left me hers. Anyway, they said they would be back at around 1am ( they did not get back till like 4am ). So at about 2:36 am I went to put my niece to bed because she was getting fussy. Now I have babysat before and it was rare for a kid that young to completely shut up. So about 5 minutes in, my niece goes dead silent, no cooing, no soft whimpers. Nothing. I got a little nervous but I figured she just fell asleep, it was late after all. That&#39;s when the baby monitor went off, I did not even bother to check it, I bolted into the room and the minute I stepped into the room I grew sick to my stomach and that haunting feeling that something was here that should not be.  I pushed it aside and scooped up my niece who was very awake when I picked her up she started giggling. I felt relief until out of the corner of my eye in the mirror I saw movement. I slowly turned my head and the rocking chair was moving back and forth with very steady movement, consistent movement. I vomited in my mouth a little from fear. I let my motherly instincts kick in and laid my niece down on the couch when I ran out of her room. I took a knife from the kitchen and checked the air vents, thinking the wind moved the rocking chair (no air), then checked in on lucy ( Their spudsmackinze ) who was asleep in her doggy bed, checked the locks on all the doors and windows and sweeped the house. nothing. I then went back into the room slowly, the rocking chair still going slowly back and forth ( you would think it stopped by now, especially being on carpet ) I ripped open the closet. Nothing.  At this point, it has been 10 minutes and he rocking chair still moved. I calmly shut the door, scooped up my niece and cried for thirty minutes on the couch as the baby monitor went on and off... At around 3:12 I put her back in her room with the door open, now that the rocking chair was still, I played it cool when my aunt and uncle came home.</p>

<p>I remember sitting in that chair four hours prior, Never sat in that chair again in my life</p>

<p>The scariest part, I never told this story to anybody in my life, and when my cousin came down ( she was about 23 yo ) who I have not seen in months, shared a scary story with us that involved that same rocking chair when she watched my niece. After a while, I told my aunt, who laughed and says her mother thinks that the closet in my niece&#39;s room is haunted. Coincidence? I think not</p>

At first, I thought I must have had a fever, the only dreams I&#39;d ever had that felt like this was fever dreams.  </p>

<p>I thought I was awake on my bed, on my back with my eyes partially open. Also, I was <em>totally paralysed</em>. I heard the doorknob turn and the door crack open. I felt as much as saw a dark shadow low on the ground, darting over to my bed. I felt breath on my ear and a cold, slimy tongue on my cheek. I frantically tried to wiggle my fingers, trying to move.</p>

<p>With a choked off cry stuck in my throat I nearly threw myself out of bed, my legs all tangled in the sheets. There was no shadow, and the door was shut but unlocked. I rationalised to myself that I had simply forgotten to lock my door the previous evening and my subconscious was telling me to be more careful.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t explain why my cheek was damp though.</p>

Thinking my husband has come back I open my eyes. He&#39;s not there. Maybe it was the cat leaving the bed or something. I drift back to sleep. Then a bit later I feel someone grabbing a hold of my face. The touch is gentle, intimate even. I startle awake, almost like in movies, sit up. There&#39;s no one in the room but me, I can still hear my husband being in the bathroom. After being woken up like that it took me a long time to fall asleep again. If I were prone to sleep paralysis, I&#39;d write this off as one. But I&#39;m not, I&#39;ve never experienced one, so I don&#39;t know what the hell that was.</p>

I was alone and had the door open so I could quickly run back downstairs to continue playing with my friends. I was on the toilet when I saw the figure of a man step into the doorway from the dark hallway. I looked up and froze in fear. He was blue and green and half transparent, wearing torn overalls. The scariest thing was the light hanging off of his head, illuminating his empty face. It looked like the thing on an angler fish. I screamed for my mom after about a minute of him just staring at me, unmoving, then he dissipated and I finished up and went running back downstairs with tears in my eyes. Scariest shit ever.</p>

<p>TL:DR Went to the bathroom, scary ghost man thing stared at me for a while.</p>

Just as I nearly drifted off to sleep, I heard the front gate creak open slowly and then slam shut. It wasn&#39;t windy that night. All of a sudden my dogs start barking madly, they only did that when someone was at the house. I then heard footsteps walking onto the front doorstep and then stop. Then they started banging loudly on the door. I didn&#39;t dare get out of bed. The banging then stopped and I heard the footsteps leave the front door. The person was gone...</p>

<p>Or so I thought.</p>

<p>I heard the same footsteps walk around the side of the house and stop right in front of my bedroom window. The person then started banging loudly on my window. I had my phone ready to ring 000 but then the banging stopped and I heard the footsteps fade away. I was too scared to get out and investigate. My parents came home 30 minutes later and I told them what had happened. They looked around outside and nothing had been damaged or seemed suspicious. I still to this day, do not know who it was.

Ah i know!
Ok so in one the houses i had moved into as a kid, i would learn to be haunted. Heard and saw a lot it was so creepy. I had a bunk bed thing but the top was a bed the bottom a couch. I was sleeping OK n my bed ya know as u do, but i tend to be a lighter sleeper (bc personal stuff). I heard something walking up the steps to my bunk. I assumed it was my cat as she loved to snuggles. So i turned and without opening my eyes i went tp go and reach her. I got scratched whiched pissed me off bc she normally doesn&#39;t scratch me on purpose. So i open my eyes to scold her but instead i see this man, his face was coverd into blood and the evilest look i have ever seen covered his face  his grin creeped me out the most bc it was too long to be real. Me being considerate not wanting to wake the whole house, i hid in a tight ball under my covers and cried into a stuffed animal i had. 
I at some point must have fallen bck to sleep bc my mom woke me up the next morning</p>

It was about 11 pm I was in my room watching YouTube on a Saturday night. All was well and normal until... I feel like something enters my room I don’t have a door I have a curtain as my door broke during a bad event in my past. Anyways the curtain pushes open and I hear steps leading to the end of my bed. My room went black and I dropped my phone a 7 ft tall figure is at the end of my bed it’s tall and muscular looking down on me. I can’t move at all it feels like somthing was holding me down and I can’t talk I just can’t or it was hard to. I sit there looking at it begging inside my head for it to leave. Finally I muster the strength to yell over and over again. “Get out of my room” I yell this at least 30 times. I have bad asthma and anxiety so I begin to choke as I can’t breath It feels like I’m being strangled my gma walks in and all the light returns. The way she described me was I was curled in a ball crying and yelling shaking more then she’d ever seen. I was unresponsive to her for 5 minute saying only “it’s in my room” she recites a prayer “you cannot enter my household this is a home if god and no devil can be here” she said this 4-5 times and I began to respond the first thing I do is grab her and beg her to give me air. I can barley breathe and can’t feel anything she gives me my rescue inhailer. I go to the bathroom and see hand marks on my arms and legs and my throat. I slept in her room that night. I’ve since had night mares almost nightly. All of them lucid dreams in the exact same situation the face of a demon at the end of my bed. This is all true and I’ve been haunted by it since(Edit I didn’t wanna type to many detail thinking about it makes me feel uneasy I’m sorry)</p>

I was laying on my back with my eyes open because I was still scared. My dad had this Queen Bohemian Rapsody poster on his wall (the one with Freddy crossing his arms with the other band members around him) which always creeped me out and it was hung directly opposite of the bed.</p>

<p>As i was lying there i suddenly found myself unable to move and the Queen poster started chanting the word &quot;Queen&quot;. As that was happening the blanket around me began to rise up over my face and i started crying. My dad was telling me &quot;it&#39;s okay&quot;. At some point I was able to move again and the blanket was not over my face and the chanting stopped. I asked my dad if he could take the poster down and he did, but i could barely sleep that night. My dad never saw or heard anything happen when i told him what was happening. I can only describe the experience as sleep paralysis, although it has never happened before or since that night. At the time it was truly and utterly terrifying.</p>

The doll had deep red glowing eyes, a long coat of some sort and long hair in pigtails. However, I’ll never forget the grinning and murderous like smile that it gave me when I was looking at it in the dark. </p>

<p>I quickly ran to my parents room to wake them up. Then, my Dad went to take a look at the doll with me. Once we put the lights on in my room, I had realised it was one of my porcelain dolls. The way it was sitting there on the top of my dresser was so creepy, it had completely came off of its stand from the shelf above. It wasn’t cracked or broken. Even with the lights on, I couldn’t look at it the same way that I had used to before this night. In the end, my Dad grabbed the doll and put it outside. </p>

<p>About two weeks later I went with my Dad to donate some of my things, this included the doll that I had. I said goodbye to it as I then peacefully and gratefully went on with the rest of my life... </p>

<p>That’s what I thought anyways... </p>

<p>When I turned 10/11, I went to my Grandparents house for Christmas. Little did I know that my Aunt (My Grandmothers sister) who was staying from afar, got me a present that year that she wasn’t supposed to (as my Mum had told her not to buy me anything since my Mum felt bad). I opened the gift... </p>

<p>It was the exact same doll that I once had. Looking freshly painted, and in its original boxed packaging. </p>

<p>Whether or not it was the doll I had just refurbished or a brand new doll of the same kind, I’m still to this day creeped out about this doll.</p>

<p>One night when I was preparing to go to bed next to my grandma. I had this wierd feeling that i was being watched but i ignored it. And when me and my grandma was going to bed. I looked at the doll for some reason. And it was just facing the opposite direction from the bed. And i went to sleep</p>

<p>Around 2 or 3 am. I had been woken up for some reason.(I feel like i woke up from a bad dream or something). I looked around the room and it was normal. But something was off. The doll was staring strait at me and my grandma. And then fell. I hid under my blanket cause idk what to do. And somehow i fell asleep.</p>

<p>By the morning my grandma looked frigtened( it was like she saw hell). So i asked &quot; what happened grandma&quot; and she said that &quot; we need to burn the doll&quot;. And in around 10 am she burned the doll with no remaining pieces. </p>

<p>To this day i never knew why she burned the doll. And the only reason i could think of is that night. I asked her many times why she burned the doll and it all ended with her saying that she had a nightmare of the doll</p>

The clock read 3:10am... As I glanced around the room I noticed that my closet door was cracked. Just an inch or so. This didnt make any since to me. I always keep it closed...Always. I felt uneasy staring into the darkness beyond the door. For some reason, I felt like something was staring back. Minutes went by. I slowed my breathing to try and catch any sounds in the room. Suddenly, I felt something hit me. A feeling of being pressed against the bed overwhelmed me. I looked around the moonlit room, but I couldn&#39;t see anything on top of me! Something touched my face..it was trying to force me to smile... Seconds seemed like minutes as I tried to resist. I screamed through clenching teeth multiple times. Out of nowhere our cat pushed my bedroom door open and leaped onto the bed. The presence vanished. I layed there crying and holding the cat close for the rest of the night. As far as I&#39;m concerned that cat saved my life...I&#39;m not a spiritual person, but that messed with me.</p>

<p>When I woke up, it was weird my feet were freezing cold so I tucked them in closer to my body and they warmed up. Then when I relaxed they got cold again. This went on for about 10 minutes, and as I woke up I realized that I was floating on my sleeping pad in about 2 inches of water. At that point I realized if I didn&#39;t have an inflatable sleeping pad I would have been laying in the water all night and could&#39;ve easily gotten hypothermia.</p>

<p>I then had to hike the 10 miles back carrying my waterlogged gear in soaking wet clothes. It sucked and I was cold as shit the entire time, but eventually we made it back. I was able to change clothes and warm up but that was one of the most miserable and creepiest hikes I have ever been on.</p>

It was &#39;late&#39; one night. (I say late cause it felt late but I was probably like 10.) I had. Loft bed in my own room and I was playing my DS, and was up later than I was supposed to be. The lights are all off, it was pitch black except for the light shining on my face from my game. All of a sudden I hear a loud &quot;PSST&quot; it was so loud it had to be near by. It wasn&#39;t muffled like it was coming through the door from my siblings. It was in the room. I couldn&#39;t pinpoint where the sound came from. It came from everywhere, but no where at once. A good 5 seconds after the first one I hear the second &quot;PSST&quot; It sounded like someone was trying to get my attention. Like they wanted to tell me something. My heart was racing and I was panicked. I turned my DS around to shine the light around my room. Nothing. No one. My door was fully closed. I quickly turned off my game and pulled my covers up to my eyes terrified. </p>

<p>The next day, I talked to my parents. I asked them if they had heard anything. Their room was just across the hall from mine. They heard nothing. I asked my siblings if they had done it to play a joke on the youngest. They denied.</p>

<p>I sometimes want to believe it was one of them, but can&#39;t. The noise was no where near muffled. It was clear as day. I don&#39;t think a human can make a &quot;PSST&quot; sound so loud, clear, and soft.</p>

In the summer of third grade, my best friend invited me to go camping with her and her family for an entire week. It was about 4 or more hours away from home, which at the time was far for me. We got there, set up the tents, and went on with our day. My friend and I had our own tent up on the hill where our campsite was. I remember our tent specifically was the closest to a nearby creek, but the farthest from the fire pit. Later that night, once it was pitch black outside, we decided we were going to go to bed. We walked up to our tent and took her German Shepherd with us because we didn’t want to be alone. About an hour passed by and all was completely silent as we began drifting off into sleep. Suddenly her dog, who was fast asleep and normally not a very noisy dog, jumps up and starts barking and growling loudly, looking up at the small skylight at the top of our tent. There was no one around us but her family who were all down the hill by the fire pit. Scared we sat there silent in fear until the tent slowly started to lean down on us, covering us as if something huge was on top of the tent. My friend screamed at the top of her lungs and her family came running. When they got there, we told them there was something on the tent but when they looked there was nothing there. I don’t know if they scared whatever it was away or if they just couldn’t see it, but something was definitely there. We slept in her sisters tent for the rest of the trip. I still get goosebumps when I think about it to this day.</p>

Years ago, when I was about 3 years old I woke up in the middle of the night. I had a CD player that I listened to when going to sleep and it got stuck and the more it replayed, the more it broke. I was annoyed and a little scared so I sat on my crib. I was about to call for my dad when a shadow like creature started coming slowly towards me through the window. It looked like a woman wearing a draping black gown that was also a part of her body. She had red eyes that were locked on me. I for some reason just stared at her. I didn&#39;t try to scream, I didn&#39;t try to look away. That&#39;s all I remember. Oh, and the CD player is still working but my little sister is using it.</p>

Whenever I would be by myself I made sure my dogs would come with me around the house. One night at about 9ish, I heard my name get called. Loud. At first I thought i imagined it because my dogs barely moved when it happened. But then it got even louder. This time both of my dogs had gotten up and started barking. They both had their tails between their legs and barked like crazy. After a minute or two of frantic barking, they both chilled out. My parents came home about two hours later and I had to pretend I wasnt freaking out the rest of the goddamn night. </p>

<p>Shoutout to Cami and Bubba. 💜💙</p>

But, a few months ago I experienced the worst sleep paralysis I&#39;ve ever had.<br/>
I was dreaming, typical nonsensical stuff when suddenly I woke up, based on the light coming in the window it seemed as though it was early evening, I freaked out, assuming I had missed my alarm and slept all day. I started getting out of bed when I heard something outside my apartment, a commotion. I went to my balcony and saw smoke outside, it was so thick it made the sky dark, there were plumes of fire and men with guns - and they saw me.</p>

<p>I realized the front door was open, I had left it unlocked the night before! I ran over and tried to close it, but it wouldn&#39;t shut, I couldn&#39;t lock it. I ran to my bedroom, slammed the bedroom door shut, grabbed a baseball bat and tried to hide, but I heard them coming in the front door. I couldn&#39;t get away.  </p>

<p>Then I woke up. Laying in bed, it was still only barely light outside, early evening. I was sweating. I turned to check the clock when I noticed the door to the bathroom was closed - I never close the bathroom door. I heard something outside the bedroom - footsteps. I had just woken up from a nightmare, I assumed my mind was on high-alert.<br/>
Until the bathroom door opened.<br/>
A short, slender man walked out from the bathroom, he was wearing all white, he had a hoodie on that covered his head and a blank, white mask obscuring his face. Though I couldn&#39;t see his eyes, he turned to look right at me. He held a finger up to where his mouth would be and motioned for silence - I couldn&#39;t see it, but I was sure he was grinning. His other hand was in his jacket pocket, he was holding something. He turned, opened the bedroom door, walked out into the hallway, and closed the door behind him. As the door shut, I realized I recognized the figure - I had seen him in a night terror years previous. The last time I saw him, he was bludgeoning a sickly girl to death with a wrench.  </p>

<p>Then, I woke up...<br/>
I was laying in bed, it was grey and murky outside. I heard my phone beside me, it startled me at first but I calmed down and grabbed the phone, it was a call but the number was unknown. I picked it up, I had been waiting on a call that wouldn&#39;t have been in my contacts. At first there was nothing on the other line, then static, then the sound of radio channels skipping back and forth, different voices saying different things. I pulled the phone away from my ear - this wasn&#39;t my phone. I looked over to the nightstand and saw my phone, still sitting there, but this unfamiliar phone was using my charging cable.<br/>
Then behind me, I felt it before I heard it, a disembodied presence, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up and a chill ran down my spine as I heard a woman&#39;s voice softly say my name.  </p>

<p>I woke up with a start, but not from the experience a moment before, instead to the sound of my bedroom door banging. Something on the other side was pulling the handle of the door hard, slamming it against the frame over and over again, I watched as the handle jiggled. I tried to scream, but I couldn&#39;t open my mouth, I was petrified. I felt the air in my lungs unable to escape me.  </p>

<p>I woke up...<br/>
I was laying on my side, out of my peripheral vision I could see the bedroom door. I laid there, motionless. I was cold, soaking wet from sweat, my eyes hurt.<br/>
I couldn&#39;t move. I could feel the familiar sensation of paralysis, but I was fixated on the door, I couldn&#39;t even begin my normal process of regaining motor control.<br/>
I stayed there for a long time, not moving, barely able to breath, not blinking - just waiting.   </p>

<p>Was I awake? Was this another nightmare in a nightmare? Could I feel, or was I feeling what I was being made to feel? I don&#39;t know how long it took me to regain control of my body, but it took hours for me to feel certain I wasn&#39;t dreaming, and days to feel truly normal again.</p>
