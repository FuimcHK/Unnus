I could guarantee it because the chair was moving. Then I heard beeping that came from my watch, almost as if i set the alarm (I never did since my watch is so damn loud). I just sat there, frozen, to scared to move. I tried to scream but nothing came out. Finally I managed a loud “MOM!” My parents ran into my room and turned on the light. The chair was moving because of the vent it was near, while the person was just black pants and a wire shirt for the next day.</p>

I have nightly hallucinations so I&#39;m usually pretty numb to freaky stuff, but this really got me.</p>

<p>For some context, my hallucinations consist of a 7 foot tall all black figure with a creepy, glowing white smiley face, no details or hair or anything, just completely black and white, very skinny as well, when he shows up, usually everything except my bed has black arms growing out of it, very few move but some seem to be grabbing at the air looking for something.</p>

<p>One night, really recently actually, I was having one of the hallucinations and starting to panic a bit, when the creature put their hand on my shoulder and I heard a whispering voice echo around me saying &quot;listen.&quot; I stopped breathing, willingly, I didn&#39;t wanna drown out any noise and make it angry. Then, I hear a slightly distorted ambulance siren in the direction of a town not far from my house, I had turned to the creature and asked &quot;Was that what I was listening for?&quot; and the creature nodded, and slowly went away through my door as the arms sunk back into the walls and floor, the siren had stopped, and I slowly drifted off to sleep. That same night, I had a nightmare where I was helping someone near that town into the back of an ambulance, I didn&#39;t recognize their face cause it was wrapped in bandages like a mummy. After they had gotten into the ambulance it started to drive away, but slipped on black ice and crashed into the gas station, causing the whole thing to explode.</p>

<p>When I woke up from that nightmare I was shivering uncontrollably, I wasn&#39;t even cold, I got up and went to school and my day continued as normal, until I heard that one of my teachers was taking the day off cause her friend had died of a heart attack near the same gas station in the dream.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll never forget that night, freaked the fuck out of me. I have one more story but I&#39;ll only leave that to those who are interested.</p>

<p>When I was about 6 or so, I lived in a big blue house. The house was creepy as it was but it never really bother too much. The typical old house things, ya know, creaky floors, cold drafts, chipping paint.</p>

<p>My room was off the kitchen, almost like a servants (?) quarters. It was small and didn’t have a lot of room to move around. My parents, sister, and cousin all day rooms upstairs, so I knew at night that I was the only one on the first floor. </p>

<p>I have trouble sleeping and music was the only way that I would fall asleep quickly and stay asleep. I’ll admit that I listen to it at a pretty high volume, it made me feel less alone and less uncomfortable. Most nights, my mom or my dad would come and turn it down without waking me. So, one night, same as any other, I put my music on and fall asleep.</p>

<p>Later that night, maybe around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, I wake up. Not because my music had been turned down or off but because something did not feel right. It felt as if I was not alone anymore and my heart was pounding. I look to the foot of my bed and see a tall figure looking at my radio with its head tilted. I thought it was my dad, considering how tall the figure was. </p>

<p>“Dad?” I ask, rubbing the sleep from my eye. The figures head snapped back to place and it turned around, slowly. I was still half asleep at the time and I was certain that whoever this was had to be my dad.</p>

<p>When the figure turned around, it’s eyes were bright red, almost like the lights of a red LED. I froze, I wasn’t able to move and my voice was stuck in my throat. This creature growled at me and pounced on me.</p>

<p>I woke up the next morning gasping for air and had bruises on each of my arms.</p>

<p>I tend to have a lot of weird dreams, honestly I probably have more nightmares than dreams (mostly due to stress/unresolved problems), and even if they aren’t nightmares they are usually just very odd. Well, one night a few years back, I had a dream where I was in one of my classrooms. It was dark and quiet with only me and a classmate I barely knew (I’ll call her K.) The nightmare was horrible, K was tied to a chair while I watched myself mock and humiliate her. This went on for a little bit, with K pleading to be let go and wanting me to stop talking, until I grabbed her hand and broke one of her fingers (her pinkie finger on her left hand.) The dream ending as she cried out in pain.</p>

<p>Okay, that was weird and I really didn’t like that but oh well, it was over and I would never do that in real life. I barely even knew K, why was I dreaming of her? Anyways, I just tried to forget about it and got ready for school.</p>

<p>Time passed and I went to one of my classes (I believe English?) and it just so happened that K had the same class (I believe it was one of the only classes I had with her.) I saw her and I just...froze. K had a finger brace/cast on her left hand, on her pinkie. I couldn’t believe it, I walked up to her and immediately asked “K, how did you break your finger?” (Trying to be all cool about it but probably looking like I saw a ghost.)</p>

<p>K looked up at me and smiled, saying “Oh, I fell down the stairs yesterday. That’s why I wasn’t at school.”</p>

<p>I didn’t even know she wasn’t at school yesterday. Again, we barely talked, I barely acknowledged her existence so the situation shook me up a bit. I’ve had one or two more dreams that have “come true” so to speak but never to that degree. (Usually, having a dream that “X teacher was late to school and oh, X was late to school on that day.”)</p>

<p>Purely a coincidence (I don’t really believe in psychics and telling the future.) But still, that moment really had my mind racing and I would be lying if I said I didn’t act like a saint towards K whenever I could afterwards.</p>

When I was around three of four I was sleeping at my bio fathers house (he had us on weekends). My twin sister and I shared a full size bed at the time and since she would fall of the bed a lot I usually slept on the outside while she got the wall. Well that night I was the one to fall off the bed. Rolled right off. I have no clue how but when I landed on the floor something went right through my chin. Not the front of my chin. This wasn&#39;t a case of biting through my lip or busting my chin open. No. Some unknown object went straight through the underside of my jaw, right under the tongue. We never found out what it was and now 23 years later I still have a smooth scar there. I did have to go to hospital since it would not stop bleeding. 
With a related incident later that year that involved me walking into the &quot;play room&quot; at my grandmother&#39;s house ( I walked out of the room with a scratch that extended from my knee to my ankle that was bleeding heavily, but I hadn&#39;t felt in happen and we couldn&#39;t find what did it) - I was completely convinced that the monster that lived in my grandmother&#39;s basement was following me from house to house and sticking its&#39; long claw through the floor to catch me. </p>

<p>TL:DR I fell off a bed and got stabbed through the jaw when I was 3-4 by an unknown object. I was convinced for years that it was a monster.</p>

<p>First, we were having roll call in the staff office when the alarm for the museum on site goes off. This alarm is to stop people from breaking in (obviously lol) and it was my turn to look after the museum for the day. So I go in and check the doors, nothing out of place, they&#39;re all locked with no sign of anyone trying to get in. Then I open the temporary exhibition (another smaller privately owned collection of artefacts which gets swapped out every six or so months) and the door seems completely fine. Just in case I check all the artefacts and everything&#39;s in it&#39;s proper place.</p>

<p>Until I look up and three panels above the glass cases installed in the wall are open. Keep in mind that they are about 4 metres (13 ft) off the ground, and no one could reach it without a ladder, which we don&#39;t keep in the museum anyway and to open the door, you need to go through a series of steps in a specific order. To make it even worse I asked my managers if this has ever happened before, and they said no, and they hadn&#39;t seen anyone on the security cameras either.</p>

<p>The next day, I&#39;m in the museum again, and I keep getting tapped on the shoulder, poked in the back, and getting my clothes tugged, even when there&#39;s literally no one around me.</p>

<p>Now the third day is the real kicker. This time i&#39;m stationed up at the actual Stonehenge monument itself. To provide context, no one AT ALL is allowed within the stone circle and there are barriers set up everywhere, and the visitor path is a giant circle around the stones, with the closest you can get being around maybe 20 metres (65 and a half ft) away. There are four of us in total roughly north south east and west of the circle , all watching to make sure that nothing bad happens, like people hopping the fence or answering questions ect.</p>

<p>All at the same time, we all see a lady in a white dress walk into the stone circle and all at once we radio each other about the woman. of course it&#39;s a HUGE no no for anyone to be that close to the stones, even the staff, so we all move in from different points to box in the lady, we all draw close and there&#39;s no one there.</p>

<p>All four of us saw this lady at the same time, and we all moved in from different points of the circle, so there was no way that she could have run away without any of us seeing.</p>

<p>Freaking Ley Lines man, and I do have more stories, both at Stonehenge and at other historic sites such as stately homes which I have volunteered at.</p>

One night, I couldn&#39;t sleep and I was just laying on my side bored, when I hear the familiar footsteps of a certain heavy person, but they sounded different than normal. I started to sweat as the person stopped in front of my door, slowly opened it, went right in front of me and just stared at me. They looked like a black silhouette to me, but it still looked like &#39;dad&#39;. They raised their hand slowly and started to pet me gently for about ten seconds, then rested their hand between my hip and my thigh. Mainly my thigh. They stayed there for an extra five seconds before leaving, and I didn&#39;t even hear my door close. Occasionally this person would caress my cheek or kiss me. This has happened to me several times ever since I was 5 years old.</p>

<p>Another story was actually very recently, last Halloween in 2019. I was trick-or-treating with my three friends and my older sister. We had gotten tons of candy, and were very happy. We were passing by the Elementary school when I noticed two men wearing completely black hoods and clothing were standing by the front door. They noticed us and slowly started to walk across the lawn straight towards us, seemingly following us. I pretended not to notice. I noticed the others when they reached the sidewalk and were possibly speeding up. We crossed the sidewalk to test them, and they didn&#39;t even wait a moment to cross the street to our side. Luckily, my house was right around the corner, so we decided to hide in my house. My sister told our parents and my dad went outside with a shotgun and looked around the area. He told us after coming back that he saw no one that matched our stalkers description.</p>

<p>They just-disappeared without a trace.</p>

<p>I have tons more stories but those were the first ones I thought of. I also have a camping story but eh. I&#39;ll post that somewhere else.
Je suis très fatiguée. Salut.</p>

I live in the U.K btw </p>

<p>I was in the living room where I asked my parents to take my Yorkshire dog (coco) in my room. My room had a one window looking out beyond my back garden and my bunk bed (because I had an older brother) was next to window. It was getting dark so I decided to take coco down to her bed, suddenly she started barking at the window uncontrollably like something was there. I didn’t think of as much since she usually acted like this, but this time it was different. I thought nothing of it And took her downstairs while I head for my bed at the top while my brother slept at the bottom and drifted of to sleep. I woke up half awake In the middle of the night my eye lids were heavy but I looked straight ahead of me and there it was a dark shadow person was standing by the window still with it’s arms slightly bent and distorted and a hunched back whitch look broken and bent I thought nothing of it as I thought it was my brother who woke up for water so I went back to sleep. I woke up again probably 20 minutes later and it was still there just standing by the window, I took a good long look and realised...it wasn’t him. It’s body was a dark black and was constantly pulsating like it’s body was made of maggots. It slowly turned to look at me with a gaze whitch I can only describe is like daggers then I saw it, it’s eyes were staring to glow a blood red making eye contact with me. It wanted it’s presence known. I hid under the covers to wait out the storm and comprehend what I just saw my heart was racing with my body having fight or flight reaction. I took another peak under the covers and it’s grotesque face was inches away from me with its blood shot eyes gazing into my soul and it’s pulsating face Constantly bubbling like boiling oil I decided to sleep under the covers that night shaking from what I just experienced. I moved out of the house 2 years later.</p>

The house was built in the woods in Des Plaines, Illinois and it is one of the historical houses. It was used as a red cross for the military and at one point was used as a children&#39;s hospital. When my mother used to live there she was pregnant at the time with my older sister. One time as she was sitting in the upstairs living room she would hear children&#39;s laughter and see little kids peeking around the corners like they wanted to play or something. This was only one of the many occurrences that happened at the house. Another time my mother was at the house alone waiting for her husband at the time to come home. She heard keys jingling like her husband was trying to unlock the door, but when she went downstairs to greet him no one was there.</p>

<p>The creepiest incident that occurred there was quite recent, maybe a year or two ago? A family friend came over with his two daughters. The daughters were maybe around 8-10 years old? The two little girls went upstairs while their father stayed on the first floor in the party room. The girls were upstairs for a while but one of them came down to join her father in the party room. The other girl was still upstairs most likely exploring the house. Although a few minutes later she came running down the stairs almost in tears saying there was a stranger upstairs. Apparently she heard someone walking around and she thought it was her sister coming back up the stairs to play with her. What she saw though was the same thing my mother saw years before, a little girl peeking around the corner wanting to play with them.</p>

<p>Every time I went to that house I personally never saw anything but I definitely got a weird feeling like something was watching me and my family. Also on the first floor of the house in the party/conference room, there is a women&#39;s and men&#39;s restroom and I honestly try to avoid the women&#39;s restroom on the first floor at all costs. I&#39;m sure nothing has ever happened in that bathroom but I always get the worst feeling when I go in there. I feel as if someone else is in there with me. I&#39;ve felt that way about that restroom since I was really little. Currently one of my sisters lives in that house with her father, they are the caretakers for the house now. One last really quick creepy fact about the house is that my mother&#39;s ex-husband was able to capture three different coloured orbs in a picture. The picture was taken in the party room of the house. There were two blue and one pink orb.</p>

The thing looked up at him. My grandfather immediately tried to slam the door shut, but the blue thing was faster. It shoved its ghostly head through the closed door and said into my grandfather&#39;s face, &quot;What are YOU doing here?&quot; </p>

<p>My grandfather was always able to provide the details, like how the things head was triangular and how cold it felt to be near it. I&#39;ll never know what it was or why it was watching me sleep.</p>

I had came home that day drained and decided to take a nap. I went into our garage ans grabbed a blanket and lay down on one of the couches for my nap since both bedrooms were occupied. The couch i fell asleep on has a perfect view of the kitchen and the master bedroom down the hall. I was on my side, thinking about the test i had the next day. Eventually i fell asleep snuggling with my blanket. It was nighttime probably around 7 or 8. I woke up like i normally would but i was on my back facing the kitchen. I just stared into the dark before seeing a figure near the small drawer we had in there. It was all black except for its head and hands, they were white. I stared at it for a long time before trying to call out to some one but it felt like a hand was around my neck. From the corner of my eye i could see my step dad come out of his room and head to the kitchen. I tried to call to him but he just looked at me as he stood at the opening of the kitchen. The figure stared to reach out for him as it got closer. As my step dad turned on the light, the figure disappeared. I sat up confused and scared. Normally i would&#39;ve &quot;woken up&quot; afterwards but i was already awake. I asked my step dad if he saw anything and he just shook his head and told me no. He told me &quot;eso es lo que pasa cuando mirras una pelicula de espantos&quot; (That&#39;s what happens when you watch a scary movie). I wasn&#39;t able to go back to sleep after that. I still see this figure every now and then. Sometimes it would be when i enter a room or in my dreams. My little sisters have started seeing this figure recently.</p>

<p>There are man other scary things me and my family have experienced but for now this is the one that still bothers me till this day.</p>

<p>Okay so when my dad was growing up he lived in a pretty haunted house. One night my dad was trying to fall asleep but he couldn’t so he opened his eyes and was about to go to the other room to get his mom (my grandmother) when he looked over there was a women clothed in white staring at him. My dad freaked out and decided to try and leave the room and get his mom. As he tried to run out of the room the lady dashed in-front of him and stood in front of the door not allowing him to leave until he got back in his bed. She then went back to her corner and stared at him for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>Another story is something that happened to me. I’m pretty lucky in that my mom refuses to live in a house that she has any reason of believing it’s haunted but when I was spending the night at a family friends house I got freaked out briefly. My and my friends (more like siblings) we’re playing with bright up lightsabers on the left side of the room. Eventually I looked over to the right side of the room when I say the shadow of someone sitting in a old chair of theirs. I ended up screaming, causing the shadow to shoot out of the chair and run out of the room. My sister tried to convince me it was my imagination when Jordan (one of our friends) looked at us and said “Oh yeah. That’s our grandpa and that’s his chair. We see him sometimes.” And the rest of them agree with his statement. I still go over there but I never stay alone in that room. It always feels as though someone is watching me.</p>

<p>A story with my mom was actually her workplace. My mom was the manager for Chuck E Cheese in Colorado and her location had two ghost. One was a little girl who had chocked on a grape and died and the other one was a middle aged man. They don’t know how he died. Anyway when this location had drapes and even after, it was common to hear a little girl running and giggling, even causing the drapes to move and for the man to be heard talking. Anyway one day my mom was closing the store alone. She had told all the other workers to go home, even making sure they left. Anyways she was working on the ice machine when she heard talking from the office space in the kitchen, and went to check it out. Upon coming up to the door she saw the shadow of two men behind the door talking. My mom quickly shut the ice machine, grabbed her purse and booked it out of there.</p>

<p>Another incident happened with my uncle when he was living alone in his apartment. Anyways, his room was connected to a balcony but had to door on the entryway. Anyway one night he was sleeping when he woke up and rolled over and saw a man with a gaunt face on the balcony watching him. My uncle slowly woke up and went and got some water and the walked back to the bed. The man’s eyes followed him the whole time. My uncle never did go back to sleep and the man disappeared just as morning came in the blink of an eye. This became a nightly occurrence until he moved out.</p>

<p>A story involving my grandma (mom’s mom) took place in her childhood home. Growing up people would be in and out of there house constantly but one day my grandma was there all alone, she was laying out her clothes on the bed and turned around to grab another article but when she turned back, the clothes were gone. Apparently this was a common occurrence and they never did get those clothes back. </p>

<p>The last story I’ll tell is about my grandmother (dad’s mom) and the house she was staying in when she was younger. This house had a lot of incidents but the one I remember the most clearly is when their lights went crazy. The lights kept brightening and dimming randomly throughout the day when suddenly the lights brightened into a blinding light. They ended up calling the electrician to look at it but all he had to say was that there was no logical explanation for the lights. He also said that with how bright the lights got, they should’ve blown but they didn’t, they were in perfect working order. That wasn’t the last incident.</p>

<p>That’s not all the incidents involving my family but there are a few of them.</p>

A fact you should know before reading. I am hard of hearing and I can&#39;t hear most sounds without my hearing aids. So, it was late at night, the girls slept on the ground floor and the boys slept upstairs, then I hear a knock at my door and one of my guy friends calling my name in a panic. I got up and went to the closed door and asked him why is he up so late and for him to go back to bed but he kept on begging me to come with him and something scary was happening. So, I opened the door and my friend was not there. I was surprised that I wasn&#39;t freaking out when I saw that my friend wasn&#39;t there but then again I was tired and didn&#39;t fully get what was going on then, so I went right back to bed. </p>

<p>Then the next morning came and I heard from my friend and a few of his roommates that there was someone that walked passed their window last night, even though they were on the second floor. It makes me wonder if what happened to me at my door, even if I was dreaming how did I know that something scary was happening to him. If it was real how can the thing sound so much like my friend. Also, there is the fact before that I can&#39;t hear without my hearing aids yet I could hear him so clear that night even through a closed door. This is a mystery that has followed me for many years.</p>

Years ago, my family were returning home from a vacation trip late at night. We turned onto our neighborhood&#39;s road as I started to doze off. My eyes quickly opened up after someone in the car yelled &quot;What the hell!&quot; which made us all jump. We asked what was wrong to which they responded with &quot;I swear I saw someone laying in a ditch&quot;. Not far from the house, my family decided to head home to dropped off some luggage we had in the car. After doing so, we returned to the ditch that supposedly had a person in it. The ditch resided in front of a old decaying house that was a familiar sight as we passed by it everyday heading towards home. By time we returned, the ditch was empty but a human silhouette was running around in the front yard of the decayed home. Turns out, the silhouette was of a young girl which is the granddaughter of the homeowner. The more frightening part of the story is what kind of parental guardian would let their grandchild stay outside at close to midnight without supervision?</p>

Once I reached the living room, I looked to where I had left my blanket, draped over the couch. But instead of my blanket there, I only saw a young girl sitting there. She had dark hair that covered some of her face, she wore a dirty dress, and one of her eyes was missing. There was a doll in her arms that had the same features.

At 4AM  I woke up and I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. So I decided to watch some YouTube videos till i got tired.Then all of a sudden I heard these stomping footsteps come from downstairs to my room upstairs. It climbed up my stairs to the top bunk bed where I was sleeping. I freaked out and hid under my cover&#39;s and prayed it would leave and it did. As I give a sigh of relief I panicked because my brother was sleeping on the bottom bunk.I leaned over and thankfully he was ok. But not even 5 minutes later it returned but it did the same thing. It stomped up into my room climbed the stairs and looked but there was nothing there as the stairs creaked it then again left. It scared me so much that I got down woke up my brother and we slept with my dad for the rest of the night.The next morning I asked my sister&#39;s if they heard or saw anything that night. They said no. Then I asked  my dad if it was him he also said no. I knew that it wasn&#39;t a burglar or an animal I dont think it was even human. This experience terrifies me till this day.</p>

I have dense woods outside my house that I usually take my little cousins for walks through. My parking lot goes right next to my house, a small path connecting it to the front door.</p>

<p>One night, as I was coming home from pet-sitting my sister&#39;s dog, I had an immediate feeling that something was wrong. However, I couldn&#39;t just go back and crash at my sister&#39;s place. She&#39;d think I was a pansy. Anyway, I often get paranoid over the smallest things</p>

<p>As I pulled into my driveway, my breath hitched.</p>

<p>There, behind one of the thinner trees in my backyard, was a man crouched down low, acting like he had a good hiding spot. I remember every stupid detail of his blue varsity jacket.</p>

<p>My head swiveled around, frantically looking between the left and right windows until it finally settled right in the man&#39;s direction. I forced my breathing to slow a bit and tried to think rationally.</p>

<p>My hands fumbled around in my bag before finally grabbing my phone. As I should&#39;ve done earlier, I dialed 911 and shakily held it up to my ear. It rand twice before a woman picked up.</p>

<p><em>&quot;911, what&#39;s your emergency?&quot;</em> the lady asked.</p>

<p>Of course, I don&#39;t remember every detail about the conversation, but I told the woman about the man, gave her my address, and she told me the police were on their way.</p>

<p>I talked to her for a little while until I heard sirens in the distance. The man got up from the position he was in and walked away like he was meant to be there.</p>

<p>They never did find him.</p>

It was starting to get dark so we slowly started to make our way back to Nick&#39;s house. Near the park, there was a fenced-off townhouse yard area that was completely empty. </p>

<p>As we were passing by we noticed a tall black figure standing near the edge of the fence just standing there, almost as if they were watching us. Kristian pointed this out to us so we decided to get back much faster now. When we crossed the street we heard a rustling of grass and bushes, we looked back to see the figure even closer now and inching slowly possibly trying to go unnoticed. At that moment we all knew this wasn&#39;t something to mess around with and Kristian yelled out at us to run. We all sprinted through the neighbourhood as fast as we could and out of curiosity I turned my head around. The figure was running now too which lead us no other choice but to run even faster. </p>

<p>We made a sharp turn and made our way to Nick&#39;s door and once we got in we locked it right away. I checked the side frosted window to see if the thing had traced us to the house, I saw their figure near, looking for us. I stayed there until 10 pm so I could get a drive home. </p>

<p>To this day I haven&#39;t been to that park, I&#39;m not sure if we all hallucinated the same thing or if we were REALLY close to something bad that night.</p>

<p>I made a Reddit account just for this because I feel like I can finally share this weird experience.</p>

<p>When I was around 14-15 years old, my mom, younger sister and I volunteered at a horse sanctuary on the weekends. We helped get it back on its feet, cleaning the horse stalls and looking after the owners dogs and pet pig. This sanctuary was located along a long and narrow road through the countryside in the middle of some fields here in the UK. The sanctuary owned the fields on either side of the road, but the sanctuary was located on the top side. </p>

<p>One day we ended up staying late as usual and it had already gotten dark, the only light there was was the orange glow from the street lamps. We were in the middle of nowhere and the sanctuary had no electricity, so for the last few chores we always had to use torches. 
The owner had a few boxes of things she needed to bring home, so my mom offered to drive her to her house as me and my sister would walk her dogs back. She only lived 10 minutes down the road and we walked them back often.</p>

<p>So they packed her boxes in the car and left. My sister and I put the dogs on their leashes, locked the gates and started walking. We were talking and the dogs were pulling on their leashes pretty hard. We were probably around 30 steps from where we just left from when I turned my head to look at the horses in the field opposite the sanctuary. They were all huddled in the corner nearest to us and looked a little nervous. Which was weird because this field was probably the size of 2 football fields and they were all in that spot. </p>

<p>My eyes then wandered to the centre of the field. I blinked a few times because I wasn&#39;t sure on what I was seeing. In the middle of the field I could see a green glowing light. I squinted but I could only see the light. I turned to my sister who had also noticed it, her face looked as though to say &#39;I see it too&#39;. &quot;What&#39;s that green light?&quot; She asked, she looked a little disturbed. Keep in mind, we were in the middle of nowhere and it was dark. I turned and looked at it more, &quot;maybe it&#39;s a jogger running through the field?&quot; I tried to reason. But the light was not bobbing up and down like it would if it was attached to someone jogging. It just kinda floated there and was slowly moving towards the left side of the field. &quot;But it doesn&#39;t look like it.&quot; I thought out loud. &quot;OP, I&#39;m creeped out, what is it then?&quot; My sister looked more nervous. The dogs hadn&#39;t made a single noise, they were actually weirdly quiet, so I didn&#39;t think it was anything dangerous.</p>

<p>We crossed the road to try and get a better look at it, we saw the light still travelling to the left of the field. That&#39;s when I realized the light was really far away but it still looked big. So this light was probably the size of a fully grown person. We watched it for another few minutes until suddenly it just faded and disappeared. When it did, me and my sister just looked at eachother, &quot;We have to tell mom about this.&quot; My sister said. I agreed and we started walking again and we kept turning our heads back to see if we could still see that weird unidentifiable light, but we couldn&#39;t. It had disappeared.</p>

<p>If any of you know what it could have been please let me know, because I&#39;ve been stumped for years and I just call it the &quot;alien light&quot;.</p>

My parents separated and my father owns the house now. I still feel uneasy there, and can&#39;t sleep as well there as I can in my new home. I havent had too many scary things happen in the new house, and hope not to. </p>

<p>Stories are separated by explainable and unexplainable events. These are my stories. </p>

<p>Explainable Stories:
One night, in the early fall and junior year of my highschool, I had gone to bed a little shaken up. I had watched a cop show that night about a teenager dying in a car accident and it left me a little scared. Regardless I went to bed and later that night, around four in the morning, I woke up and heard a loud sound. I had a fear of burglary at the time and It sounded exactly like the sound of a tall metal ladder sliding down or collapsing itself. So naturally I didn&#39;t get out of bed immediately, until I saw headlight out my window. Turns out, that sound was the sound of crunching metal wrapping around a tree. Someone had crashed into a tree in my front yard. After having watched that cop show, I panicked thinking the person had died. I watched for a little to see if maybe they&#39;d step out of the car okay and when no one came out I ran to call 911. I woke my parents up and they went outside to check while the ambulance came. 
Everything was okay. The person inside was a very tired old man who had dozed off and missed the turn at the intersection. He was lucky to make it out without a scratch. Though I&#39;ll never forget that sound, and learned not to panic in situations like those. If something like that happens dont wait like I did to call 911. I was a dumb scared kid, and I know you guys can be much braver than me. </p>

<p>Unexplainable (Ghost?) stories:</p>

<p>To clarify, I was raised to believe in ghosts. I tell these stories and I dont believe in ghosts to this day, but I cant deny they have no explanation as they occured. </p>

<p>1.) One night a week or two before christmas, we had ordered PizzaHuts giftbox deal that came with three pizzas and a cookie pizza. We were eating in the living room and I had finished eating, sitting in a recliner chair, and had a cookie pizza slice sitting on the end table next to me. My little brother at the time really liked sweets and while watching tv I saw a pitch black hand out of the corner of my eye reach for and take the slice. I though it was my brother so I smiled and looked behind the chair and called out to him. HE WAS NOT THERE. Neither was my fucking cookie, it wasnt even on the end table. I looked across my room to see my brother playing his Nintendo DS, and asked who took it. No one took it, and I just shrugged it off. We found it later in our TV remote basket, all the way across the end table. I never put it in there, and can&#39;t explain what I saw.</p>

<p>2.) Another time I had gone into my sister&#39;s room to retrieve a pencil she had stolen from me. There was a bunch of sentimental junk sitting on her dresser. Of these things was an old Little Pet Shop dog. He was about the size of a small rock, and about half the weight. I remember finding the pencil on that dresser and as I was walking out the door I heard a loud as fuck bang while seeing something hit the door frame. It looked like whatever was thrown at the frame was thrown like a baseball pitch, because it hit hard. I look on the ground to find that Little Pet Shop dog and bolt out. My sister and brother wasnt in the room, both were outside in the hallway. </p>

<p>3.) This is much shorter than the other two, but every night before I&#39;d go to sleep Id hear voices call my name. I dont hear it at any other home, and it&#39;s the same voices everytime. (That being a young girl, a perverted old man, a wicked mid 50s lady, and a super manipulative young man.) It was scary the first time I heard them because they were very noticeable. After a while I got used to hearing them every night before I went to sleep. Technically I debunk this one as me being traumatized by a bad family past and the house never being quiet. I like to think my brain is trying to fill in the silence at night, but I cant confirm this since it doesnt happen anywhere else, so...a tad unexplainable.</p>

<p>4.) The most frightening moment in that house was when me and my sister needed to get something out of my brothers closet one night. While she went into the closet I stood outside it in the hallway. I felt something touch my spine. It felt like it was a single index finger, just barely hovering over the skin, enough to feel it. It was slightly above the waist band in my pants and slowly slide it down lower. I was so scared I didnt move. I watched my sister turn around, look at me, and scream aloud. She told me she saw someone behind me. No one else was around though. I cant explain this one at all. I do my best to forget about it. I dont like the concept of what might have happened that day.</p>

My mother, and really everyone else in the house didn&#39;t really like to say the house was hunted, except from my aunt and I. It all started when we first moved in (which was at age 5) the first few days nothing happened, just us unpacking and setting our rooms up. It was a three bedroom, two bath room house with two living rooms, one up stairs, one downstairs, in what we used to call our &#39;dungeon&#39; it was all in good fun at the time. It was maybe night four when the first thing happened, I woke up to a loud bang at my door. Assuming it was a teen brother playing a prank on me, sense it was 3:18ish, I just said &quot;Hey! Stop it Cody.&quot; and went back to bed. the next day I found out my brother went to his friends house after I went to bed. And everyone else said that they were not up at the time. That&#39;s when I realized that it could have only been something else. After that I would be woken up by a loud knock at my door, always at 3:18am. When I was 7 I had gotten somewhat used to the knocks until my aunt and her daughters came over for three days. They live in Hawaii so we don&#39;t see them much. But anyway, that night I was talking to my cousins on my bed when I saw the cracked open door slowly open. It was slow enough that I knew it couldn&#39;t have been the wind, and just behind the door I saw a dark figure just staring at me.</p>

<p>Not doing anything but just looking at me. I slowly pointed to the door and asked if my cousins saw the door opening, but when they turned around they asked what I was talking about and that the door was still closed. After rubbing my eyes, I saw that the door was closed once again and but a shadow of feet could be seen from behind the closed door. The next morning I was walking up stairs wanting to get some water to hopefully wake me up (I didn&#39;t sleep much that night) when I heard my aunt and my mom talking. My aunt said at around 3:40 she went to get a glass of water from the kitchen but when she put her hand on the light switch, she felt someone put a hand over hers and say &quot;Shhh&quot;. Things only got worse after that, I would hear footsteps at night, in my room things would be in different places, and if I ever slept with my back to the room around 3:18 again I would feel a hand on my back and someone saying &quot;Shh&quot;. We stayed in that house for another 8 years before we moved. When I got older though something told me that whatever was in the house wasn&#39;t bad. The night before we moved the last of our stuff, I had a dream of an old man knocking on my door only to realize that his wife was almost dead. To help her from panicking he gently placed a hand on her back and said &quot;Shh, its ok, I&#39;ll see you on the other side.&quot; and when he looked at the clock it was 3:18am. </p>

<p>Its been a two years sense we moved and I&#39;ve only been back at the house a couple times. My uncle now owns the house now. And every time I&#39;ve went, I have the strongest urge just to stay in my old room and live there again. I also feel lonely after I leave for a day or two. When I think back on my memory&#39;s I realize that, maybe the old man was just taking care of me, and making sure I was ok. Keeping me calm and such. Sense the days he would put his hand on my back I was having a bad day, it could have been because of bullies, all the yelling I had in my house, or my grandma telling me I was nothing but &quot;White Trash&quot; as an insult. (I&#39;m Mexican so it was an insult, and made me feel very isolated). I think he was trying to be there for me, and sometimes I feel bad for moving. Maybe I&#39;ll move back to the house with my uncle when I go to college. </p>

<p>Sorry for the long story! I love your guys videos! They make my day when bad things happen. (which is a lot, my grandma is still very much and issue and the yelling and arguing in the house doesn&#39;t really help) But I know I&#39;ll be able to have a happy life when I get out of here! And that&#39;s Thanks to you guys! Thanks for reading my story, and sorry its so long again! OvO</p>

(backstory on house): The family that owned it just before my parents did had a little boy around the age of 9 he died in the house. The mothers boy randomly went phyco and killed her son. She was arrested and is held uo in a max prison some were in were i live. Now for years me and my siblings and even my father have claim to see a little boy in the house... (FIRST CONTACT) Me and my family were sitting down watching a movie. I remember loseing intrest so i look around to my family I couldn&#39;t see my brother, so naturally thoight he most of went to the rest room. At that very moment i see a little shadow enter door way right next to the Tv. This Shadow only lit up by the light of the tv I watched as it droped to the ground. I stand on top of my couch to get a better look of it ( another couch blocked my view) I watched as the shadow twisted and turned and mangled it self. Inshock I fall off the couch. I land just right to watch the shadowy mass crawl on all 4 cross the ground i remember hearong the sound it mad as it flung its limbs to the carpet while that happen it took a corner and i could no longer hear the crawling along with it disappearing and never to be found as soon as  the shadow is gone i look back to the couch to see my brother looking around around from my mother.... I was the only one to have seen the shadow child in that instant. BUT later that night i got to bed around 11pm to 12 am that night I hear a constant  banging  of door, pots, and pans clattering in the kitchen i brush it off thinking it was my mother in the kitchen and then I hear her(my mother) in the bathroom yelling to find out who was messing with her clean kitchen... my heart sinks I yell for my father and brother thinking it was them no response it clicked to me that my brother was already snoring and  asleep and my dad is always asleep by 9 do to work. I grab my little fishing knife my father had given me as a Christmas gift and, stormed to the kitchen... My mother said her &#39;kitchen was clean&#39; remember, I enter and there were pots slung across the room and door flung open. I dropped to the ground and put everything away not thinking as to why I was cleaning everything. my mom comes in after me to see everything was fine. She yells at me asking why I was up so late at night and why I was making so much noise in the kitchen I just yell at here (i guess in shock) &#39;it wasn&#39;t me&#39; and she realize I was telling the truth. i went to bed and well this should be were the story ends. I wake up that same night Ihear the door knob clatter like some one grabbed it from the out side I look up to see a little black boy shadowy mass followed by a another huge shadow i see the bigger shadow step in to the room and watch my door slowly close in front of the two what ever you want to call them demons ghost and it opens again to reveal an empty hall way. I forever sleep with a closed door after that..... As I got older the shdows lingered and seemed to be not as violent and in a religious house hold I decided i was going to tell &#39;the demons to go fuck off.&#39; I grabbed my bible and a cross necklace remembering that night I told the two to leave reading scripture randomly throughout the house and slinging my cross necklace around... That same night all the street light flickered off, my neighbors motion detection light beams would flicker. I watched the lights blink from my security cameras around the out side house. My dogs would also lose their minds running from front door to back door all night for a good three hours. Ever sense then I haven&#39;t seem to notice any shadows or anything.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>A Whisper In The Night (Story 1)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Six years ago I was woken up in the middle of the night to the sound of somebody whispering &quot;hey&quot; into my ear. The voice was a very robotic sounding voice, almost as if there was a little toy robot placed next to my ear, unfortunately there wasn&#39;t. I was so scared that when I heard it I let out a little shout. I opened my eyes and I didn&#39;t see anything except for my clock, blinking bright green. The time isn&#39;t exact but it was just about a quarter past midnight when this happened so I knew everyone was asleep. I always felt something wrong with that room, even before that happened, like somebody had died there. To this day I don&#39;t know what it was that made that noise, but it shook me so bad that ever since then I&#39;ve slept with the light on.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Sleep Paralysis (Story 2)</p>

<p>This story happened pretty recent, maybe a month or two ago and it still scares me. This time I was in my living room watching Mark or Jack, as usual. It was really dark outside, being that it was early morning, and I was getting really sleepy. Where I live now, we aren&#39;t supposed to sleep in the living room, so I laid my head down on the back of the chair I was sitting in. I was sitting up with my head in an uncomfortable position so I knew I wasn&#39;t going to fall asleep, or so I thought. I was only asleep for about 15 minutes when I slowly regained consciousness from my little &quot;nap&quot;. When I woke up I noticed I couldn&#39;t move, but I could see, hear, and feel things. The most terrifying thing about this was the thing over on the couch that I couldn&#39;t hear, see, or feel. I just sensed it. It was so horrible because the noise from the fan, which I had left on, sounded like it was coming from the monsters direction. I might have been able to open my eyes, but I was more afraid of what I would see if I did. I knew I was in sleep paralysis so I tried to move my hands and eyes around. I could only see the backs of my eyelids because my head was tilted up towards the fan light which, stated in the last story, I always leave on. I started trying to rub my belly to see if the feeling would help me wake up. When I finally got to the state to where I could move again, the first thing I did was open my eyes and look where the creature was. There was nothing there, nothing except the lingering feeling of evil. I was too scared to go back to sleep, knowing that if I did that the monster was sure to be there. A few weeks go by and nothing happens, until I fall asleep on the couch. I was in a nightmare, something I hadn&#39;t had in years, and what do I see but the very creature from my sleep paralysis. I was terrified, it was as if all my worst fears came to life. It was incredibly tall, with long thin limbs, and fingers that stretched on for what seemed like forever. It was so bony, it looked like a walking skeleton. The worst part to me though were the teeth, the long sharp teeth, the bottom ones started where the bottom of the neck would have been, its whole face was teeth. I&#39;ve always hated teeth, I&#39;ve had too many dreams about them falling out, so this creature was literal nightmare fuel. It was such a horrible  creature and when it wanted to trick me, it would look like a little boy. I know this is the same creature from my sleep paralysis, I just have that gut feeling, the same horrible feeling of evil. I woke up after seeing the creature. I was so afraid that I started crying. I hadn&#39;t felt so scared since I was little. (I&#39;ve been biting my tongue in my sleep ever since this happened, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything to it or if it&#39;s just a coincident)</p>

<p>please remember that these stories are real, I don&#39;t have an explanation for the first one, and the second one was just my scary experience of sleep paralysis for the first time. I have never since slept in the living room at night, but I fear that if I do, I&#39;ll see the creature again. I don&#39;t nap in the living room anymore either, I get the same feeling from the living room as I did from my old bedroom. I hope I never experience either of these things again. Super sorry these are long btw</p>

<p>When I was a really little kid about 6 or 8, my dad had just finished building our new house, he tore down our old one and rebuild it from scratch. I used to share a room with my sister, but in the new house we each got our own room. One of the first nights I was alone, I remember sleeping soundly when I woke up because I felt a pressure at the end of my bed, like someone sat down. I opened my eyes, and a blurry, all black shape sat at the end of my bed. It looked almost like a person, but had no disingenuousing facial features, he was just a blob. He reached out to me, and I wanted to sit up but I couldn&#39;t. Then he got close to my face, and I don&#39;t remember anything except him being gone, and sitting up, and scurrying down the hall. I thought my parents had come to check in on me. I opened their door and asked why they woke me up and who was sitting on my bed? They both bolted out of bed, turns out it was 1:45 in the morning and they&#39;d been asleep for hours. My dad searched the whole house but never found anything. I still don&#39;t know if it was a bad dream or what.</p>

<p>(here&#39;s the second one. This stories more eerie than anything, with a twist but still interesting none the less)</p>

<p>When I was younger I had what I thought was an imaginary friend. He used to follow me around and he was tall and had sharp nails with a messed up face and he wore a tattered suit and had stray sections of hair sticking out of his head. We were friends. But one day I remember sitting in my kitchen, and he was sitting next to me and saying he was sorry, really sorry. But he had to go and that he was evil. I didn&#39;t understand, I kept asking him &quot;where are you going? Can&#39;t you be my friend anymore?&quot; and he just shook his head and said that he had to go, and I almost cried.</p>

<p>Then like, he turned into Voldemort in front of my eyes and like? I don&#39;t know if that was my child brain coping or what. </p>

<p>TLDR; I had a demon &quot;imaginary&quot; friend</p>

<p>It all started when I was 5 years old, although what happened exactly was blurry, I can clearly remember the significant details. Basically, I had caught a terrible sickness back when I was still living in UAE. I was coughing uncontrollably all the time and it got so bad to the point when my hair started falling, my mom says that I nearly went bald. Doctor after doctor, test result after test result they weren&#39;t able to find what was wrong with me. One night after a visit to another hospital, I remember being extremely tired (Because I was walking around a lot that day and I was pretty young). I jumped into my bed after a warm bath and my mom tucked me in, she was hesitant to leave me that night, as I was coughing more than usual. She made me drink my cough syrup and left the room. As a child, I wasn&#39;t all that scared of the dark because my ceiling was covered with glow in the dark stars. But something wasn&#39;t right because there was a painful tightness in my chest. I didn&#39;t want to go get my mom about this because I was a dumb kid, also because she looked really tired. Looking back, she was probably still awake that night, looking for a doctor that could help me. Regardless of the pain, I was still extremely tired, so I just went to sleep.</p>

<p>Late at night, a force suddenly pushes my back, causing me to sit up. Startled, I quickly get out of bed and look around trying to see why that happened. As I look around, I see myself sleeping in my bed. Out of curiosity, I move closer towards myself and try to poke my sleeping head. Astonishingly, my finger went through its face. Being a small five-year-old girl with a wild imagination, I thought that I became a ghost. Rather than being scared, I thought it was cool ( I wasn&#39;t allowed to watch horror movies as a kid, so I was relatively clean in that area). I run around my room to touch things, and just as expected, my hands went through everything. While I was running around having fun, I suddenly felt a presence behind me. I turn around to see a tall black figure in black robes. Despite how it looked, the aura it gave off wasn&#39;t scary or repelling. Instead, the feeling it gave off was peaceful and attracting. The figure held out its hand like it wanted me to take it, I could immediately feel my hand move on its own. As my hand grew close to the hand of the figure, I increasingly felt more uncomfortable, Like something wasn&#39;t right. I suddenly feel something grab my shoulder and throw me away from the figure, I landed on my bed. I blacked out after that.</p>

<p>In the morning I found myself sweating, I look around my room. The figure was gone. I brushed off the experience as a bad dream because I usually have crazy dreams all the time. I didn&#39;t want to tell my mom because I knew she was stressed out and didn&#39;t have time for my stories.</p>

<p>A week or two later, My mom finally found a doctor that could help me. I was then diagnosed with Bronchial Pneumonia.</p>

<p>I fully recovered from it at 8 years old.</p>

<p>For many years until now (I&#39;m 14 now) I have continued to have that type of experience, except that the black figure isn&#39;t present anymore. For 6 years I thought it was a normal bad dream, until 7th grade (When I was 11). I shared a recent story of that one of my recent experiences (at the time). One of my classmates explained to me that what had been happening to me all this time was something along the lines of astral projection. That night, I googled astral projection and felt sceptical. Out of curiosity, I called a friend whose mom was supposedly a psychic. I told her my story, something I have never done before that time. I remember feeling embarrassed because for all I knew it really could&#39;ve been a bad dream. My friend&#39;s mom explained to me that during that night I nearly died in my sleep and that the black figure in my room was death, he was coming to collect me. However, the thing that grabbed me away from him was a guardian angel or deity of some sort. I was surprised but still sceptical. Until today I still go around asking people who might have answers to my story. Priests, psychics, mediums, even science and psychology teachers to see if there were any logical explanations. Science and psychology teachers weren&#39;t able to answer me, but the priests, psychics and mediums always say similar things.</p>

<p>&quot;You were supposed to die that night, and you were being picked up.&quot;</p>

<p>Regardless of whether or not they are telling the truth, If it is true, I&#39;m thankful for the thing that saved me. This is the first time I have publicly shared my story, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if most people don&#39;t believe me. Believe what you want to believe, I&#39;m not trying to stop or change that fact. If there is anyone out there who has similar experiences that I have, please reach out to me.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t know anything about what happens to me every time I have &quot;astral projection&quot;, but what I do is that every time I get more tired than usual, When I fall asleep, I enter that state.</p>

<p>So I sleep over at my best friends house all the time, we’ve been best friends for going on 14 years now, and this happened probably when we were 16 or 17 I think? So she has a pullout bed that goes next to hers, and we sometimes switch which one we sleep on. That night, I slept on the bed closest to the farthest wall from the closet, and she slept on the outside bed.</p>

<p>I mentioned the closet because this is the creepiest closet I’ve ever seen in my life. It sits right in the corner of the room, the light from the window hits the door just right to where you can’t see inside, and the door cannot shut, it always stays slightly open. Now back to our tale of horror.</p>

<p>My friend has always talked in her sleep, but it’s always been simple nonsense. Random words, some gibberish here and there, but she doesn’t do it often, and it never makes sense. She always goes to sleep before I do, and I can always tell when she’s sleeping, as her breath pattern changes and becomes deeper and slowed. She was asleep, I had checked, but I was quietly listening to music, or watching one of Mark’s videos, I can’t remember. Suddenly, she sits bolt upright, like her body was suddenly full of electricity. Humans usually don’t sit at a perfect ninety degree angle with their legs out in front of them.</p>

<p>I immediately stopped what I was doing and looked at her. “Hey [bestie]? You awake?” No response. I listened to her breathing, still slowed and deep, her eyes still shut, facing forward. She was still asleep. I sat as still as I could, slightly worried. But as soon as I thought I maybe should lay her back down, her head started to turn. Slowly, it turned until she was directly looking at me, but her eyes were closed the whole time. Still the same slow deep breaths. One second. Two seconds. Silence. And then,</p>

<p>“...watch out for.. that man in the corner.” As her arm raised up, hand outstretched toward the closet.</p>

<p>And as quickly as she sat up, she fell back down with her head in the pillow, breathing as calmly as she had the whole time, eyes still closed. I didn’t sleep that night.</p>

<p>I asked her about it in the morning, and she had absolutely no recollection of what I was talking about, and told me that she had slept wonderfully.</p>

<p>I still don’t go near the closet.</p>

<p>My mom and I went to a Cemetery years ago and we experienced something that still to this day I can not believe happened. She was driving up to the Cemetery and we noticed a light and dark brown police car sitting at the parking lot. We thought it was odd that there was a police car there. When we arrived at the Cemetery the police car was still there. We were about 15 maybe 20 feet away and we were visiting someone&#39;s grave. When we looked up just a couple minutes later, that police car was gone. We would have noticed it drive away considering it was literally in front of us and gravel was covering the narrow roads. Not to mention the Cemetery is on a high hill and you can see the road for miles away. That police car was no where to be found...</p>

<p>I was probably around 11 or 12 years old and i was laying in bed i shared a room with my little sister, who was 4, she was afraid of the dark so we kept the hallway light on and the door ajar. I was having a rough night sleeping and was wide awake tossing and turning, i rolled over on the bed and was facing the door and thats when i saw a tall thin shadow standing in by the door, i slowly raised myself to my elbows and i guess me moving triggered the figure because he began to walk towards me. I scrabbled back to the corner of my bed, the figure walked all the way to my bed and bent down as if to look at me. I sqeezed my eyes shut and waited about 30 seconds and then opened them and it was gone. </p>

<p>I still see shadow people to this day, but they no longer scare me ive seen them far too frequently to be afraid now. I did have one make me jump recently though, i was laying in bed and i got up to go to the bathroom and when i opened the door he was on the other side i jumped and let out a little yelp and then he was gone. I just muttered &quot;fuck you&quot; and went to the bathroom.</p>

These are two of my creepiest experiences. Here&#39;s the first one.
So this happened to me like last year. I was brushing my teeth in the hallway bathroom (our apartment has three bathrooms, one is in my parents room, the second is in me and my brother&#39;s room and the third is in the hallway). I use the hallway bathroom because there isn&#39;t enough space in the one with me and my brother&#39;s room. So anyway I was brushing my teeth when I looked in the mirror and saw some black thing like a boy go running behind me and into our bedroom. I thought it was just my brother but for some reason I kept looking at the mirror. No one came back. After brushing my teeth I looked into our bedroom and saw the bathroom door was closed meaning someone was inside because the lock to that bathroom was broken and you had to hold it to keep it closed. Seeing that it was closed I walked back into the lounge. My brother was sitting there in the lounge. So were my parents. I still haven&#39;t understood what or who I saw running across the hallway into me and my brother&#39;s bedroom</p>

This happened to me around two years ago. I woke up in the middle of the night with an absolutely dry throat. I felt as if though I was dying of thirst. It was so bad that I couldn&#39;t even get up to drink a glass of water. I lay there on my bed for quite a while just staring at the light falling on one of the cupboards from the hall way.
I had closed my eyes for a little while and when I opened them I saw a silhouette of a man in the doorway. His shadow was formed on the cupboard due to the hallway light. I thought it was my father so I said as loud as I could &quot;water&quot;. My parents would often check on me and my brother during the night and I would sometimes when I was thirsty just say water and they would bring it. The shadow didnt move. I thought perhaps my father didnt hear me so I tried again a little louder than before &quot;water&quot;. I was pretty sure that he had heard me. I said water around 3-4 times and when I had finally given up the shadow moved in the direction of the kitchen. I didnt notice at first but that shadow had a different posture than my father&#39;s. My father would walk with a completely straight back while this shadow was walking with his back a little bent. I either didnt notice at the time or didnt care. I just wanted some water. I lay there for what seemed like forever but noone came back. I dont know how I fell asleep but when I woke up the first thing I did was drink alot of water and then ask my father why he didn&#39;t get me a glass of water. My father looked at me confused and said that he hadn&#39;t got up the entire night. He said he had never come near my bedroom as he had been sleeping all night. This had really creeped me out and for the rest of the winter i made sure to drink water before going to bed so that I didnt wake up in the middle of the night and see that strange man again.</p>

I was changing in my friend’s room, when all of a sudden the door slammed shut, and I mean almost broke slammed shut. Then I saw a figure with the hand on the light switch. The light turned off but I quickly turned it On again and reopened the door. I found my friends playing the ps4 in the main room waiting for me to finish. I asked one of them when the other left and they said everyone else was upstairs sleeping.</p>

Previously had just held our toys and a few boxes. My bed was in one corner of the room along with the lamp that was on. I had barely turned off the tv, since it was around 11 and i wanted to sleep,  only to glance around the room and notice in the other half of the room (slightly darker due to the radius of light the lamp provided), there was something there... watching me. </p>

<p>Now, I only realized it wasn&#39;t anything like clothing or a box because this was high above the ground. Higher than any of the chairs or boxes, or even the toys we had in there, and there was a slight glint from where the eyes would be located (as well as a glow). The moment it saw me looking back at it (and I say it because there was no way glowing eyes were anything else),  it began to shift and i noticed it could have been even taller than i initially thought. The feeling of dread that had been building up since I noticed it only getting worse, and it was in that moment that I did what i had wanted to do since the beginning, I stuck my head under the covers and stayed quiet. </p>

<p>I laid there awake for I think a solid hour, and once time passed I looked out from beneath my blanket only to notice it was gone, and I decided it was time to sleep. The rest of my sleep was spent curled up in a ball surrounded by a fort made of blankets and pillows.</p>

<p>When I was about 12 years old my family and a friends family went to the place called Squire Castle ( it&#39;s actually just the gate for what was supposed to be a castel in NEO that was never completed- this was more like a guard house). It got boring quickly and all eight kids decided to play hide and seek. Oh yeah this place is in the middle of the woods. So I&#39;m hiding just barely within the tree line (like six feet from the &quot;castle&quot;) when something skitters up the tree next to me. Whatever it was was huge! I jumped and ran toward the building to get my mom but when we came back there we couldn&#39;t see anything. She said it was probably a raccoon. I thought it was a bear. It was probably a raccoon lol.</p>

They were usually purple, black, or white blobs in the shape of humans. Sometimes I saw them just walking around my house, just these ten foot tall figures looking around my kitchen. They didn&#39;t do anything, for the most part. I didnt bother them, they didn&#39;t bother me. Until one night. I was in bed, just about to fall asleep, when I hear something from the upper left hand corner of my room. It sounded like it was coming from something hanging in my corner. &quot;Sam, goodnight.&quot; It whispered. (Sam is my name). I was terrified out of my mind and didnt get any sleep that night. I tried to tell people about it, but they just told me it was my sister telling me goodnight. But I know my sisters voice. And it didnt sound like that. I brushed it off as time went on, and eventually forgot about it, but the figures stayed around, even at school.
       I was in school, eating lunch with my friends. We were just talking, when my friend stopped mid sentence with a confused expression and said, &quot;Why are there scratch marks on your neck?&quot; I was as confused as her, because I hadn&#39;t been scratching my neck at all that day. She said there were long sets of two or three claw marks on my neck. I started to panic, because I couldn&#39;t feel them appearing. Every 3 minutes, she told me fresh scratches would appear. They faded after a while, but every now and then they would still show on my neck.
      At this point, things were getting serious. The figures appeared more frequently and I started to see them everywhere, even with my friends. I remember seeing one looming over me in a school bus, and I got absolutely terrified because it looked like a human, just much larger.
      As I got older, I stopped seeing the figures, which I found odd. Every now and then, whenever I think about them, they appear again for a brief moment, like they will always be in the back if my head. That was probably the scariest time period of my life, not just because of the voice, but because I still have no clue as to what the hell those figures were.

This one particular night I woke up in the middle of the night. Now my house has two stories, but the stairs that lead to the second story carry sounds from downstairs all the way upstairs, so you can hear some things going on downstairs. I decided to go sleep with my parents, because I had a hard time falling asleep in my bed. I passed my brothers room, he sleeps with his door open and i peaked in to see him laying in bed. Moving on, I ended up stoping at the stairs because I heard something coming from downstairs. I listened, and could hear footsteps. My house has wooden floors, so i hear someone walking against the wooden floors, and it could&#39;t have been the house creaking because these steps where consecutive. It sounded like the source of these steps where walking, but cautiously. However, since it was christmas eve, I thought it was santa. I started to question if I should go down and meet him. I decided to not go investigate because I was scared he would run away, taking my presents with him. So I went into my parents room and snuggled in with my mom and dad, who where both asleep in bed. That morning everything seemed normal. There was no evidence that someone entered our house, but some items where moved to places they weren&#39;t originally, such as family pictures or decorations. Those footsteps coming from downstairs where not my parents, or my brothers. Now that I know santa isn&#39;t real, this story becomes a lot more creepy, and sometimes I wonder what I would have seen if I went downstairs.</p>

<p>P.S, this story was a point I used a lot to prove to my friends santa was real</p>

As i was nearing the end of the movie the VHS tapes little spinning noise because scratchy and loud, so i scrambled to my feet from the chair i was in to take it out so it wouldn&#39;t wake anyone up just to see that the tape was melted completely and the tv was still going on static, i was scared more of my parents finding out that i stayed up until 3 in the morning and broke a VHS tape than anything else so i tried to hide it like an idiot just so I&#39;d have more time to throw it away later, during that time i heard the door nob attempt to turn, i looked at it scared to death of someone attempting to break in but i was under the impression that the deadbolt and doorknob lock would keep anyone out of the house, i was wrong, i started trying to slowly back out of the living room, trying hard to keep out of veiw from the window facing the front yard and back to my room to pretend i was asleep or to hide or something, and as i was staring at the door i saw the knob lock and the deadbolt slowly unlock in unison (im about to fucking cry at this point because nothing is stopping someone from walking in and seeing my weak 12 year old self trying to sneak crawl into the next room) i disregard trying to hide from veiw of the window and try my best to silently sprint into my room. I watched my clock in the most &quot;natural&quot; sleeping position i could think of while in my bed wondering why the hell i didn&#39;t tell my perfectly capable parents with multiple weapons and phone&#39;s to help me, i watched the clock as it hit 4 then 5 then 6 and i didn&#39;t stay awake long enough to see 7, the next day i brushed it ofd as a nightmare because no way in hell someone unlocks our door and then just leaves, then about 2 weeks later i wake up to see the outline of a man at my door. Me, nearly pissing myself pretend like im still asleep and go stiff, and he sat there staring at me for what felt like hours before he walked up to the edge of my bed and got around 2 inches of my face before saying &quot;i know your awake, just wait until you slip up and break that act, then I&#39;ll get to play with you more&quot; he giggled and left my room, the next day a man was caught by one of our neighbors who returned home late to see the same man standing at the entrance to his daughter&#39;s room, he was apparently on some hard drugs and was a registered sex offender, needles to say but he got the hell beat out of him by my neighbor and was thrown in prison for a long ass time</p>

 pretty cheesy, but here goes ...</p>

<p>At the time this happened to me, I was probably around 12 years old, and I’m pretty sure this was my first experience of sleep paralysis. Anyway, I sleep on the top bunk of a bunk bed, and when someone’s climbing up the ladder, you can feel the bed shift just a small bit, and the ladder creaks like an old floor board. Anyway, I woke up to that feeling and sound one night... Bear with me, as this is where it gets kinda cheesy. Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 had recently been released, and I had been playing it with my friends, watching Mark play it, etc. Anyway, I woke up to the sound and feeling of my bed shifting as though someone was climbing up. I looked to see what was going on and slowly, Toy Bonnie, from the video game, was just kinda climbing up my ladder and staring me in the eyes. I couldn’t move a muscle and I was terrified. I tried yelling, but I’m pretty sure no words came out, so I just closed my eyes tightly. When I opened them, the creature was gone and I jolted up. I guess my brain was being a bit too imaginative and decided to mix a game with my nightmares, but yeah. As odd as it may sound, that’s probably one of the scariest nighttime experiences I’ve ever had...</p>

A bunch of extended family had come over to my house for a big get-together and most of them decided to stay the night. My cousins and I decided that sleeping was boring (we were all between 10 and 18) so we decided to go out for a walk since 1. we couldn&#39;t do anything in the house because the adults were sleeping and 2.  it was creepy as fuck outside because an incredibly thick fog had settled outside so we could barely see the sidewalk from our front windows and we all decided that that was cool as all hell. </p>

<p>So all 7 of us told my dad who was one of the few adults still awake and I guess he must&#39;ve thought something along the lines of &quot;hey there&#39;s guards patrolling (it&#39;s pretty common in Pakistan for middle to upper class neighbourhoods to be guarded) and half these kids are practically adults so why not&quot; because he let us go without any problem. </p>

<p>By this point it&#39;s past midnight so the streets are pretty much silent except for the occasional car in the distance, the sound muffled by all the fog. We must&#39;ve been goofing off outside for about half an hour when I got the <del>stupid</del> absolutely brilliant idea to sneak away from the group to scare them. So I quietly slip away and hide behind a bush in one of the little parks in the neighbourhood and I wait for them to move along a little ways before sneaking away a couple streets down running ahead so I could wait for them to pass by. </p>

<p>After a couple of minutes of hearing nothing I started to get impatient. I hadn&#39;t run that far ahead, it shouldn&#39;t be taking them this long to get to me so I decided to slowly make my way to where I thought they might be so I wouldn&#39;t have to wait as long. As I was walking I realized that things are a lot scarier when you&#39;re alone. The fog made it so objects like cars and trees simply &quot;appeared&quot; out of thin air. Street lamps were reduced to hazy balls of dim light in the distance and since everything else was muffled, I was painfully aware of how loud my footsteps, and my breathing really were. That&#39;s when I heard it. A low wailing siren from out in the fog. It wasn&#39;t very loud but it was so... unsettling. The rational part of me reasoned that it was an ambulance in the distance or a police car but that was drowned out by the constant stream of &quot;oh shit, oh fuck&quot; in my head. Then it started to get louder and was joined by another sound. Footsteps. It couldn&#39;t have been my cousins because it was coming from the wrong direction and there weren&#39;t any voices. Just the slow steady tapping of footsteps getting closer and the droning of sirens in the distance. I wanted to run as fast as I could but I also didn&#39;t want to make any noise, anything that bring any attention to me. So I settled for walking as quickly as I could back towards where I had left my cousins, looking back every so often into the fog checking to see if anyone was there. </p>

<p>I must&#39;ve only been walking for a minute or so when the sirens stopped and the steps behind me seemed to get louder and faster. I looked back and saw a tall, thin, shadowy figure in the fog. All logic and reason left my brain and without a second thought I turned around and booked it as fast as I could towards the park where I ran into my cousins who immediately started screaming because apparently a figure running at you full speed in the middle of the night is scary. who knew? I told them about everything that had happened but since I was known among them for being a little shit who regularly pulled pranks like this, they all laughed it off and kept going on like nothing happened. </p>

<p>Nothing else out of the ordinary happened for the rest of the night. We got some snacks from a 24 hour corner store and went back home and somehow I managed to fall asleep.</p>

My phone was almost dead so i was watching out the window at the passing field. In the distance I saw lights that we&#39;re close to the road and unmoving, considered it a farm house amd thought nothing of it, but as we got closer the lights turned off. I looked close into the dark to see it since it was close to the road, and it was a pretty bright night because of a clear sky and full moon. There was nothing there. I asked my mom if she saw it and she said yes and stopped the car so we could look for a second. Nothing in miles besides fields. I still wonder what it was</p>

<p>Another story:
This was after my moms ex-boyfriend went crazy and tried to shot us. I was terrified and even though i was 11 I slept with my mom so if i had a nightmare she would be there. I woke up in the middle of the night one night and stared at the open lit doorway there was someone right there. I could be swore. I stayed silent unsure if it was a dream. The figure walked around the bed and went to my moms dresser and grabbed something, swiftly leaving. I stayed awake frozen. I heard nothing outside or anywhere in the house and we had a dog that barked at anything no matter what (he has barked at pizza on the tv) I fell asleep thinking it was paranoia, but the next day my moms phone was gone. And we could not find it anywhere. We tore up the house and everything. We never found it, and searched for about another week and reported it gone.</p>

<p>These might not be too scary but they freaked me out.</p>

Okay so I have been told that this isn’t really scary by my friends but I don’t think they understand how bad is to wake up in a panic attack.
So around the start of 2019, i’m a big night owl I stay up really late and my mom has a job at a camp and stayed at ten camp for the week so she wasn’t home at all. At my house we have trails that lead to mud trails that we like to go riding out there. Both my dad and my two brothers decided that they were going to go on the trails with some friends and I wanted to stay home.(my dad acts like a teenager so he hangs out with teenagers) And for some reason it was just a really strange night, I honestly had no idea why I just had a really bad feeling. I decided to just throw the bad feeling in the back of my head and go to sleep, I like to sleep with my door opened so I have more light and my cats can come and sleep with me, but I remember that both of my cats didn’t join me when I went to bed which they usually sleep with me. I just assumed that they just didn’t want to sleep yet or didn’t want to sleep with me tonight. But I started hearing inhuman like noises from my two older brothers room. Which got me very frightened because i can see my brothers door while I’m in bed, our rooms are literally right across from each other, and I never saw anyone go into my brothers room and never heard the front door open so I slowly got up shaking and grabbed a lil pocket knife I have on my dresser (just Incase) and slowly started walking to my door and quietly closed it then locked it and then quickly while trying to be quiet called my oldest brother and asked if anyone came back to the house and he said no, then he hanged up. And I was starting to cry and started looking for a  way to get out of my room through the window which I wasn’t strong enough to open it they are very hard windows to open. About 20 or 30 idk minutes later my oldest brother called me back saying how he just found out my other older brother got very sick and went back to the house. Which explained that the inhuman noises where my brother brutally throwing up in his room. I calmed down a little bit but was still shaken up and finally laid back down for one of my cats to jump up on my bed scarin’ the crap outta me. Soon my cat started looking directly at the wall behind me for a while causing me to jump and quickly turn around. It was just my wall. I could still hear my brother throwing up that entire night. I finally fell asleep at 12:24 or something at night. Then I woke up In complete panic, I felt as if I would run out of air at any moment I drank a lot of water from a barley even filled warm water bottle from right next to my bed. Every thing was turning grey and I couldn’t stop panicking I kept trying to get up out of my bed but I couldn’t until I did and I slowly went to the pitch black living room tripping on my own feet. I somehow made my way to the light and turned it on. I turned on every single light in the room and in my room and the hallway I got a glass of water that I dropped (it didn’t break) and I turned on the tv in which I accidentally dropped the tv remote on the ground causing all the batteries to fall out and roll all over the ground. I just couldn’t hold anything. My dad who apparently came home sometime when I was a sleep heard all the racket, but in the morning he said that he was so tired he didn’t check. I spent the rest of my night in fear watching movies I had taped, mostly a dog’s purpose, pixels , and zootopia. And I tried texting all of my friends telling them that I probably wouldn’t be going to the 8th grade dance that was the next day and if someone could talk right now. But it was like 3:50 AM every one wanted to be ready for the dance so they all went to bed at a good time. I spent almost an entire year staying up in the living room putting on those three movies until I fell asleep on the couch. I had to go to therapy for a while and I’m still horrified to something that happened a year ago. I at least sleep in my room now, with the help of putting calming oil on my wrist(yeah I had no idea it was a thing until my mom came home seeing me like this) and I take melatonin every night just so I can get some sleep. I ended up having so many scary things happen to me that night and all my fear grew into a panic attack in my sleep which when I woke up I was still in the panic attack. People sometimes say it helps to talk about it to others but it doesn’t help me but it Might just help someone else who’s having problems. I just wanted to share this story with you guys. And I just wanna say if you guy ever do read this that your guises videos are something I watched that I did to get my mind off all this so I want to say thank you for that, you guys made me laugh.</p>

I was probably about 7 when I was woken up in the middle of the night by the sound of the air conditioner next to my bed rattling. me and my sister shared a room and we had bunk beds. I was on the top bunk. our beds were right next to the window and since I was on the top bunk I could look out the window.i peeked out the blinds and saw a dark figure outside my window. I quickly laid my head back down and hid under the covers. I was too scared to run to my parents room as it was on the other side of the house. the AC unit was screwed into our window frame by my father so that it couldn&#39;t be easily removed. and I&#39;m so glad for that now. I woke up the next morning and my parents were watching the news and I was sitting on the couch with them. On the news was a story about how there was a murder on my street in the middle of the night. I don&#39;t remember much because I was so young but I do remember my mom telling my dad to change the channel because she didn&#39;t want the news to scare me. I tried to tell my parents about what happened the night before but they didn&#39;t believe me and said the news was just scaring me. I think about that all the time. If my father didn&#39;t do something as simple as screwing the AC unit into the window me and my family could be dead right now.</p>
