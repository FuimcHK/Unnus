<p>Here’s mine; about a year or two of my life, every month—at random times—I would wake up with dried blood caked on my body. It was on my hands, my face, my sheets, and my legs from the knees down.
The first time I found out about it, I didn’t pay a lot of attention. The next time, my brother was the one who pointed out to me that I had blood on my face and I quickly washed it off. I don’t know why it was happening. It wasn’t a nose bleed. The blood would be on my forehead, the bridge of my nose, and right below my eyes. It was never around my nose. We went to doctors appointments and showed them pictures, but we could never actually figure out what was happening. </p>

<p>I was 9 or 10 years old. I lived in a townhome at the time, which is just a big house cut in the middle. My family lived on the right side of the house and we had an older couple living on the left. </p>

<p>One night I woke up to a very strange sound coming from the left side of my room. Imagine long Tallon fingernails scraping a wall. Except it started at the top of the wall and slowly, slowly, slowly making its way down the wall.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t scared at first; I was more annoyed because it was so loud! So loud in fact that I opened my window and sat on the roof, and I could STILL hear it from outside. I was out there for 10 or 15 minutes until the noise stopped and I went back inside to go to bed.</p>

<p>The next morning I asked my mom if she had heard anything the night before. she simply said, &quot;Hun the neighbors are on vacation, no one is over there.&quot; This was when I became scared. I know I didn&#39;t imagine it and begged my mom to go and check. She said she found nothing unusual. To this day I have no idea what could have caused it and now become terrified of the saying &quot;nails on a chalkboard.&quot;</p>

This happened to me when I was 9 or 10 years old</p>

<p>It was around 10pm at night and I was about to go to bed. As I was drifting into my sleep I heard a loud bang from the wall on my left, right under the window. I didn’t think much of it so I went back to sleep. Then a few minutes later, it happened 
again.</p>

<p>It was weird, but only being a kid I was too scared to go see what it was, so again I ignored it and tried to fall asleep. It happened again, and again, and again. Over and over again, the banging became faster and louder, like whatever what was banging wanted to break into my room. By this point I was shaking and crying with fear, trying to block out the noise so I can sleep, but it didn’t stop.</p>

<p>I ran into my moms room, uncontrollably crying as I was so scared. She asked what was wrong and told her about the banging  underneath my window and went to my room to go check the window. Nobody was there, there were no indications that someone was there, no footprints, and no one on the street since it was late at night. I was completely stunned because it felt so real. So I slept with my mom that night, thinking that I was crazy and it was my imagination.</p>

<p>Or was it..?</p>

<p>my Midwest creepy stories:</p>

<ol>
<li>I was like 8 and had sliding glass doors in my room. I lived in a walk-out basement in the Midwest and it was in a huge house so I was already terrified of everything in it. Anyway, I woke up and the light from the hallway was shining onto the glass doors (which I didn&#39;t have any covers for) and saw two glowing eyes staring in at me. I quickly jumped up and turned on the light and it was a stupid raccoon sitting outside staring in. IKR not very spooky, but it kept happening... with possums, cats, and small rodents. They would just sit there and stare in at me.</li>
<li>I was like 6 and staying at my mamaw&#39;s house shortly after my papaw had died. I was laying in bed and looked over at the wall opposite me and saw the perfect shadow of a man halfway bent over on the wall. It looked like a shadow coming in from outside the window but it couldn&#39;t have been because it was a full-body silhouette. I just laid there and stared at it because it was so creepy and I felt like if I moved, it would attack me or something. I told my mamaw in the morning but she didn&#39;t believe me. That wasn&#39;t the first or last time that had happened, but definitely the most distinct shadow I&#39;d seen.</li>
<li>when I was 11 I lived out in the middle of absolute nowhere. We lived right off an old state road surrounded by just a bunch of cornfields. The closest neighbors were about 2 miles down the road. I had a friend over and we were outside playing on the trampoline when we started hearing a whistling sound like a flute. We stopped and sat on the trampoline listening. It wasn&#39;t like a melody that was playing, just random flute sounds that would randomly go up and down in pitch.</li>
<li>In the same house as before, my brother and I shared a room upstairs and in the middle of the night, doors upstairs would randomly open. Like our closets and bedroom doors.</li>
<li>Not my story but, my grandma told me that she and her friends played with a ouija board once yeaarrrsss ago. My grandma didn&#39;t really want to play with it but decided to ask it &quot;do you know Jesus?&quot; and she said that after she asked that the board levitated off the floor and threw itself against the wall. They didn&#39;t play with anymore it after that lol.</li>

I figured she fell because she injured her achilles at the time and had to walk on crutches for a week or two while she healed. I went into the corridor outside my room and started shouting for her to find where she was so I could help her up. After about five minutes of looking I heard her saying from her bedroom: &quot;What are you doing?&quot; I explained that I was coming to help her because I heard her calling for me. She apparently never spoke a word the whole night and was reading on her bed.
For years after, she brought it up to other family members because she thought it was funny but that whole story didn&#39;t sit well with me at all. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever explained my side of the story to her since I&#39;ve been both embarrassed and creeped out by the whole situation. I still have no idea who I heard calling for help to this day.</p>

My sister and I wanted to show our friends the abandoned cabin down by the river. My dad had always called it “The Witches Cabin”, he said the witch that once lived there was murdered, and now haunts the cabin. My sister and I have been exploring in that area since we were very young, so we knew it wasn’t unsafe to go through. We had asked our parents if we could go at night. (You know to give it a spook atmosphere.) Both our parents and our friends parents said it was ok. So when the sun went down, we grabbed flashlights, and headed down the path. I lead our small group of four people down the path to river. The land around “The Witches Cabin” was full of weeds and was a huge marshy area. When we got to the cabin me and my friend wanted to see if we could find a way in. We tried opening one of the windows, and we got it open a little. But not much. My friend being stupid, said he could punch the glass. I told him, “yeah imagine trying to explain to your parents why you have a bloody knuckle!” So he grabbed a piece of wood, and smashed the window. His sister yelled at him, and I smacked him in the back of the head. Nothing was in there but old storage. But I noticed above one of the windows was a small hatch. I wanted to find a way to get up there. Now me being the egocentric person I am, had to boast I knew exactly what I was doing. In truth, I wasn’t. I reached up to grab the handle and I got a hold of it. At that moment a loud bang came from inside the cabin. We screamed and sprinted out of there so fast. Knowing me I’ll probably go back there again this summer.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s mine: This has happened multiple times to me already. One day as I was waking up to a beautiful morning. I opened my eyes and tried to stand up. but for some reason I couldn&#39;t, I could only look around. Since the whole family was in one bed, including me, I tried and roll to them to try and help me. But as I was rolling to them I had a hard time breathing. Its like someone was trying to choke me but no one was there. There&#39;s not a single person doing it to me. It wasn&#39;t a dream either I could see my siblings and parents still sleeping. All I could do was to tell myself &quot; Wake up , Wake up, Wake up!!!&quot;. Eventually I stood up thinking what just happened to me. I just forgot that happened and didn&#39;t even bothered telling anyone. But it happened again multiple times in fact. There was one time that I finally woke up from it, then tried to sleep again then before actually sleeping I couldn&#39;t already move so I was scared of sleeping for a while. I tried and tried to try and let anyone interfere with what&#39;s happening but when I try it, nothing happens, it really just happens randomly. I&#39;m 17 and still have those kinds of experiences. Its not that frequent but still scares me when will it strike next and why is it happening to me.</p>

This is what she told me:</p>

<p>She grew up and worked in the northeast mountains of Pennsylvania. She worked long hours after school and in her young adult years. It was natural to take the dark, winding roads through the mountains heading home from her job at the Elk Mountain ski-resort. They were old farm roads, just wide enough for one car, and were always traveled alone.</p>

<p>It was common for her to have nightmares of her times on the road, drawn from the pitch-black nights. In one recurring dream, it would be raining, and she would make one of the sharp right turns. Standing in the middle of the road, was a man in a raincoat. He was pointing at her, which she saw through the light of the headlights. Then she wake would wake up.</p>

<p>One late night, right after midnight, she was coming home from her shift. It was raining. And as she approached the familiar turn, she got an eerie feeling of deja vu. She turned the corner. There standing in the middle of the road, in the rain, was a man in a raincoat. He was pointing at her. As she looked around, she noticed his dog. It was his dog he was pointing at, not my mom.</p>

<p>She stopped the car, realizing that if she had been going faster, she would have hit the dog. He grabbed the dog by the collar and walked up the dirt road to the farm house. She never had that dream again.</p>

<p>When I was around 13 years old I was in the backseat of my parents&#39; car. It was late at night, my stepdad was in the driver&#39;s seat with my mom riding shotgun. We were on a two lane ramp with a connecting to an overpass with lights at the too of the ramp. We were in the left lane and there was another car in the right lane next to us. It&#39;s important to note that there was very little space between us and the barrier, maybe about 2 or 3 feet. </p>

<p>We were stopped at the light for a long while when my stepdad checked the mirrors before saying, &quot;That car is not slowing down. He&#39;s going to hit us and send us over the edge.&quot; So we all quickly braced ourselves as we watch this small, red car somehow go to the left of us, going between us and the barrier without a scratch. Once he&#39;s past us, they make a sharp turn and somehow managed to stop the car.</p>

<p>The three of us are all shocked as we were sure we would be hit and set over the edge of the overpass. So we find a good place to pull over and the guy in the car gets out and he was probably only in his early twenties and he was apologizing over and over, explaining that his breaks suddenly stopped working. He didn&#39;t feel safe driving for the rest of the night so we helped him move his car to a safe spot and took him home.</p>

<p>To this day, my family and I still believe that we should&#39;ve died that night and we have no explanation as to how he get between us and the barrier. It was physically impossible, but we&#39;re just glad to be alive almost 5 years later.</p>

I went to bed around 9 o&#39;clock cause I had school the next day. And I&#39;m trying to sleep. I hate to admit it but I was scared of the dark at that time and I slept with my head under the covers. But that night I was gonna put my big girl pants on and try not to. So I take the covers off my head and give my room a scan just to make sure I&#39;m safe. I look over to the corner and I see a dark figure maybe about 4 feet tall IMMEDIATELY cover my head back up and cry. It was brownish-black, and was covered in this brown cloak with a hood over it&#39;s &quot;face&quot;. It looked like it had cloth swishing around it. The face was completely black. And I just remember struggling to breathe cause I was under the covers for at least 30 mins without getting more oxygen under the blanket. So I stuck just my mouth out of it. I did that till midnight. I take the blanket off again and see that it moved closer, and I lose it. I screamed ran downstairs and just cried to my mom. I told her what happened and I slept on the couch that night.  I told my friends at school the next day and they asked if I had something in the corner to look like that. And I said no. Because I was moving into that room. I had nothing up there but a light and my bed. And the light was on the wall. On the opposite side of the room. Time skip to 7 months ago I moved out of that room about a year ago and into the basement About 5 months into living in the basement, I saw the same figure on the stairs watching me when I sleep sometimes. It&#39;s an ongoing occurrence and I can&#39;t seem to get away from it.  It&#39;s not a story for me, Its a reality. I like to think it&#39;s just a family member watching me to make sure I&#39;m safe. But then why does it look so terrifying. I still sleep with my head under the covers sometimes. Only when I see it.    Thank you for reading the whole thing if you did. It means a lot for you to take your time over this.</p>

<p>Once I was at a friends and I went to take a shower. Her dad worked nights so he was usually asleep during the day so I had to made sure I was super quiet. Halfway through the shower I heard footsteps and I assumed it was her dad. Her house is old like mine with hardwood floors and they squeaked very audibly no matter where you are in the house. So, after I heard the footsteps I never heard them retreat back to the bedroom. Then the shower went cold, and I’m not talking about the water. I was under scorching hot water and I was shivering. I felt like someone was in there with me so I just randomly sang a worship song from a church I hadn’t been to in years(i am also not even super religious) but somehow it gave me comfort. I sang at a low volume so no one could hear me, and eventually I was able to warm back up. So I get out of the shower and everything is fine, I start to get dressed. </p>

<p>Let me paint the picture of how this bathroom sink looked before I say what happened. </p>

<p>It’s a long counter with one sink and a giant rectangular mirror that stretched the length of the counter and stopped a few inches below the ceiling. </p>

<p>When I was putting on my pants I looked up at the mirror and at the very top was a giant handprint. This thing was massive, the middle finger was longer than the rest and all of the fingers looked like they came to a point and there were droplets of water where each finger pad would have been. I ran downstairs and grabbed my friend and asked her if that was her footsteps I heard but she has been in the basement watching tv. Her dad also wasn’t home that day, he was out golfing. The mirror was so high up that it didn’t make sense for anyone to have touched it before and then the steam covered it. I have no clue but I do know that regardless it’s SPOOKY. I used to have photo proof but this was probably 6 or 7 years ago. I NEVER showered there again.</p>

<p>Edit: the best way I could describe it would be the handprint on the sheets in the movie insidious. With the long pointed fingers and the abnormal size.</p>

<p>When I was in high school one of my good friends died. It was really hard to deal with. I have had depression for as long as I can remember and I would hurt myself to cope with things sometimes. One night after my friend had passed I was going to hurt myself to deal with everything I was feeling. I was alone in my room with the lights off and someone went to the bathroom that is just outside my door. When they turned on the light I could see it through the cracks in my door where it didn&#39;t meet with the door frame. As the light poured in I saw the outline of a body that appeared to be at the end of my bed. I freaked out and immediately turned on my lamp. Nothing was there. And my dog was calmly laying by my side like nothing had happened.</p>

<p>When I went to bed that night I had a dream about my friend. Nothing to crazy but we sat and talked on this bench I had never seen before. I can&#39;t remember want all was said, this has been 3 years ago but after that night I felt more at peace with him being gone. I still missed him but it wasn&#39;t like before.</p>

<p>My family has always had an unusually long history of strange things happening to them. Seeing unexplained figures, strange happening ect. My father once said he saw his sister (my aunt) walk past his door in the middle of the night before proceeding to repeatedly bash her head into the corridors wall but when he looked to his left she was asleep in bed. When he looked back the figure was gone but he says he can still hear the sound of its forehead meeting the wallpaper with a sickening crack. This is just one of the many stories my family has of unusual and nonsensical happenings over the years and it definitly did not stop with them. </p>

<p>My family lives in a city but I myself live with my mother and her boyfriend in the country. Now, usually when you think Irish country living the word serenity comes to mind and youd be right. It&#39;s not a highly populated area, our closest neighbours are pretty far away, so we dont see people very often. That&#39;s why it&#39;s really weird when we do. </p>

<p>I was on a walk by myself not that long ago, the sun was going down and I was trying to make it home as fast as possible when a car appeared from around the bend driving much too fast for irish country road standards. I walked onto the bank, deciding if he hits me while I&#39;m here he&#39;s officially the worst driver in history, before he came to a screeching halt next to me. He rolled down his window frantically and shouted &#39;have you seen my cow?&#39; I was confused and startled, staring at the man baffled. The silence went on for so long he asked me again &#39;have you seen a cow out here?&#39; To which I replied no while I silently wondered how the fuck hed lost a cow in the first place, not a herd but one single cow. He said &#39;aw shit, damn things run off somewhere. You wouldn&#39;t mind helping me find it would ya?&#39; I denied his offer as politely as possible and tried walking off but he reversed to keep talking to me, saying if I helped him find it hed pay me for my trouble. I again denied, yes I was a poor student but I&#39;m not a fucking idiot. With that he drove off, frantically as ever, into the night and I was never happier to make it home. </p>

<p>The next day we heard news of an accident that had happened an odd ten miles up the road. Someone had hit a cow in the middle of the night and swerved before driving their car into a ditch. By the time we got there to check it out the road was closed but I was able to get a good look at the car, it was the jeep the man was in last night. I asked one of the officers if the man was okay and they said  the strangest thing. When they got to the scene there was no evidence of anyone ever being in the car recently, no blood no DNA no nothing (at least that they could find.) I told them all about my encounter with the man the previous night and they took the details before asking me to leave. He wasnt anyone I&#39;d seen before and when you live around so few people you tend to know everyone close by, I still to this day wonder who the fuck he was and who let him get a fucking driver&#39;s licence. I cant help but think what eouldve happened if I had been stupid enough to join him in the hunt for his cow, would I be in that ditch the next morning or would I too be gone without a single trace? Who knows. I know I never want to find out. </p>

<p>That&#39;s more of a supernatural story but the next one is completely psychological.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember I&#39;ve had terrible nightmares, ones that would make me run to my mothers room in fear when I was young. I didnt know until I was older that I some of them could be classified as sleep paralysis. So when I went crying to my mum about the vampire outside my window waving at me yes it was just a figment of my imagination but it felt much realer than that to me. </p>

<p>I used to have a bunk bed that had a space for storage under it with these little curtains my nana made me so I could make it a den for myself. One night I had fallen asleep with my head sticking out of the ladder space so I was able to see my floor. I woke up in the middle of the night and found I couldn&#39;t move, I started to feel the panic set in, tight chest shortened breath, I was about to try and shout for help when I noticed the curtains on the bottom were moving. Slowly, a pale hand made it&#39;s way out from the gap between the curtains, the palm turning upwards so it could face me. It paused for a second and I thought it was done and it was a mannequin arm, but then it started to move. It waved in a way I can only describe as... unhumanly smooth. It did this for what felt like hours, I couldn&#39;t look away or close my eyes all I could do is watch as this thing that had invaded my secluded space taunted me. After a long while it stopped waving and made a beckoning motion to me before sliding smoothly back between the curtains. I didnt want to follow it, couldn&#39;t even if I wanted to, but somehow I knew me not co-operating was making it angry and I could feel its alluring demeanor fading. After a few moments of silence and tension the hand shot back out and whacked the ground, the fingers in a claw shape as if it was trying to grab something. That&#39;s when </p>

<p>BAM </p>

<p>I hit the ground. Turns out in reality I was leaning too far out of my bed and I had fallen out of the ladder gap, thus waking me up from the horrible nightmare I was having. Of course, that&#39;s not what my childish brain thought, cause now I was on the same level as that horrible thing under my bed. I scrambled back up my ladder as fast as I could and started to bash on the wall behind me screaming &#39;THERES SOMEONE UNDER MY BED.&#39; Of course this woke my poor mother and in-the-midst-of-uni-exams-brother who both came rushing into my room terrified. My brother grabbed me as my mum checked under the bed where my horrible monster resided. Of course, nothing was there. Since then I&#39;ve had on and off experiences of Sleep paralysis, a few to do with things under my bed, but none as terrifying as that was for me. When staying with friends for a sleepover or travel I still warn them there is a possibility I will wake up in the middle of the night and bash on the walls but if that happens they should just ignore me, for the better. </p>

<p>(FUN EXTRA- when FNAF VR came I out I was super excited, I&#39;ve always enjoyed the series but it&#39;s never truly scared me. 
When I watched a letsplayer get to the end of the game, however, I was literally scared to the point of goosebumps. The part with the bunny, where he appears from behind a curtain and beckons you closer,  is so like the movement from my nightmare it brought that memory flooding back and I was officially terrified. Horror games dont usually scare me but that definitly did.)</p>

I had gone to my junior prom and drove myself to meet my friends there. We left around 11pm and I got in my car and drove off. I was really tired and a fairly in experienced driver. And it took me a while to realize I was going in the wrong direction on a main road. So I used my phone to figure out a way home. It was probably between 11:30 or 12 and my phone told me to make a left and I went down a stretch of road that turned into a dirt road in a clearing in a forrest. I was driving my old civic and it was not doing well on the road. Then I saw something person size cross in front of me in the clearing. I started skiting after braking and braced for impact. I didn&#39;t feel a hit and I looked up and nothing was there. I was to scared to get out and thought I would just yell out my window &quot;Is anyone there?&quot; The response I got was a gut wrenching scream from the distance that I couldn&#39;t identify as person or beast and out of pure fear I hit the gas and sped off and was soon on the main road pointing home. I later found out that that area had had sighting of large animals as well as the jersey devil. I don&#39;t believe in it, but I have no idea what had crossed me that night</p>

<p>One night me and my sister were reorganizing my bedroom.</p>

<p>When I was little I owned a small purple Furby that sat in the corner of my room. When Furby&#39;s get moved they turn on and start to talk nonsense and do silly dances, my sister picked up my Furby to move it to the other side of my room. As I expected it turned on and started talking gibberish. Me and my sister went back to reorganizing my room when my Furby said in a dark, scratchy, and angry voice, &quot;Hey!&quot; It sounded scary but I could understand it perfectly, I looked at my sister noticing that she heard it too.</p>

<p>We ran to my mom&#39;s room and explained what happened, of course my mom didn&#39;t believe us but she sent my dad into my room to take the Furby out. When he came out of my room he was carrying the Furby and it was sitting happily in my dad&#39;s hands, we haven&#39;t touched it since...</p>

<p>awhile back when i visited a friend’s house (there were five of us including me) we had our minds set on messing around with a quija board. Ofc nobody with a healthy mind just keeps one laying around, so we had to improvise. we made it out of cardboard and made one after watching tutorials on how to make it. we then procede to mess with it and i decide it would be a good idea to use it in the basement so it’d be scarier. the lights in the basement didn’t work so we had to improvise yet again and use the flash on our phones, we set them up behind us. at the time i didn’t believe im ghosts or demons so i ofc messed with my friends and moved the glass piece towards letters and numbers like 666 and what not. after everyone was freaking out i pretended to be scared and ran up stairs back to the living room. my friends later joined me. everyone tried to lighten the mood so we turn all the lights on and get a pizza from the kitchen and turn on a movie. this is where things start to get scary. once the movie is about 20 minutes in (about an hour after we messed with the quija board) the tv freezes. so i try to unpause it but it won’t do anything not even turn off. i decide to get up and unplug the tv thinking that would help. once it’s unplugged all the lights in the living room turn off (everybody was sitting on the couch and his parents were at work) it was pitch dark and everybody was freaking out including me. i try to find a light switch but it’s too dark to see, i stumble around while my friends remained on the couch. i find a wall and continue to look for a switch then i feel something grind my leg i thought it was a cat or something. i find a switch and flick it a couple times around the 3rd or 4th flick it turns on. i look around to see if his cat was anywhere around. it isn’t so assume it ran somewhere. then we just sit and watch the movie and blame it on his electricity so we don’t freak out. i’m convinced it was some outside force like something spiritual. later, like maybe a week passes, i ask my friend (kc the guy whose house i was at) “where’s ur cat i haven’t seen him for awhile?” he then responds “dude my cat died a couple weeks ago. it was only last week that i was at his house...</p>

So most of these revolve around my late-great grandmother who seemed to have ghosts follow her. 
1. So when my mom was younger, her and my great aunt who is near my mom&#39;s age went to my great grandma&#39;s house. So when they got there, the door was locked in 2 places and none of their relatives were there. They heard a man and a woman arguing and being young, they ran and hid in the small laundry room that was in the house. Once some of their relatives came home, they searched the house and no one was there other than my mom and great aunt. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>My other great aunt one time in that same house heard a gunshot and a woman scream inside of the house... My theory is that the past owners of that house were a couple that got into an argument and the man shot his wife and killed her. This house is also in the kinda redneck area of Georgia where most of my mom&#39;s side of the family lives btw... </p></li>
<li><p>In that same house, a few years ago my great grandma spoke of two glowing red eyes that she saw in her room in the middle of the night. </p></li>
<li><p>When my grandma was a kid, her father was on a business trip in Pennsylvania. They lived in Georgia where my whole family basically lives. So in the house that they were living in, in the hallway there was a giant grate in the floor that made a very loud noise when people walked on it. And the boots that my great grandpa had made a very specific noise on the grate. In the middle of the night, my grandma&#39;s whole family heard his boots walk on the grate and walk into the bathroom. My grandma, her two brothers, and my great grandma were all very surprised because it was way earlier than when he was supposed to be at home. They all ran out into the hallway to greet him only to find that no one was home and my great grandma called him only to find that he was still in Pennsylvania... </p></li>
<li><p>Leading up to the kinda recent death of my great grandma she would act weird... I was with her for all of these ones. Once while we were in the living room of my grandma&#39;s house where she was being taken care of since she was very old, she looked down at the ground and was laughing. She was smiling and waving at the ground and the wall next to the TV as if she was interacting with a small child... In the same room, she was talking to no one specifically. When I asked her who she was talking to, she said that she was talking to the man in the ceiling. And on the baby-cam put into her room to watch and make sure she didn&#39;t do anything in the middle of the night, there was always a bright light on her bed. It wasn&#39;t from the windows outside or the TV or anything. There was no light on the bed in real life, only on video. </p></li>
<li><p>These two happened during band camp for me last year... So I was in the bathroom changing and heard a loud noise in the last stall in the bathroom. When I looked, there was no one else in the bathroom with me. And I was walking outside at night after a practice with one of my friends. It was just us and literally no one was around us, I even checked all around... There were three shadows instead of just two... And one of them had very very straight hair when both me and my friend&#39;s hair were curly and frizzy from being in the humidity all day.</p></li>
<li><p>My brother&#39;s friend&#39;s house is VERY haunted. His mom was using Snapchat one day and was using a filter. The filter was on there twice and she thought it was a reflection. She winked but in the other filter showing up, she saw two eyes that were blue(her eyes are hazel) and they were clearly men&#39;s eyes. Her other son saw a redcoat in his bedroom. We live in the area where Sherman marched through Atlanta and burned and killed everyone and everything in his way so... That&#39;s fun. That woman also used to work at the preschool at my church and a kid was saying she wanted to say goodbye to Joyce. Her mom asked if she meant Mrs. C(the woman from this story) and the kid said &quot;no, the woman behind Mrs. C&quot;. There was no one behind Mrs. C. </p></li>
<li><p>Once in my old house, my brother was doing some work on the house and he felt one of the straps on his overalls get pulled down and get thrown off of his shoulder. </p></li>
<li><p>In another one of my brother&#39;s friend&#39;s house, they heard someone walking upstairs... They checked and no one else was home even after they checked EVERYWHERE in the house. </p></li>
<li><p>Once when I was younger when I used to sleep with my door opened like a psychopath, I woke up in the middle of the night and saw someone poking their head in from the side of my door frame and it looked like they had one of those helmets that the man from the Spongebob movie that like abducted Spongebob and Patrick was wearing... Idek... 
Those are all the ones that I can think of right now... There are probably a lot more but yeah...</p></li>

It&#39;s also a very long story so bear with me. Anyway, I was haunted by a spirit for almost 5 years.</p>

<p>So when I was about 14, me and some friends were just browsing shops in downtown Colorado Springs and came across a shop that sold some really cool trinkets, so we checked it out.  I found a really cool Japanese fan that I was considering buying, but I wanted to use both hands to look at some glass figurines, so I (stupidly) put the fan sticking out of my back pocket. Then suddenly one of my friends rushed over to us and said that there were voodoo and witchcraft things in the back of the store. And us being the Good Christian Children that we were, got the fuck out of there real fast. But as we were about to leave, the shop owner started yelling and running at us.  In my hurry to leave, I had forgotten that I stuck the fan in my back pocket. Me and my friends apologized profusely and begged him not to call the police. Clearly still very angry, he agreed to let me buy it and leave, but as he was ringing it up, he was whispering things under his breath while holding the fan very close.</p>

<p>After that, any time I looked at, touched, or was even near the fan, I would get nauseous. I originally chalked it up to a subconscious reaction to a traumatic experience. But then, a little while later,  other weird things started happening: flickering lights, temperature dropping, strange noises, etc. Then one day, mabey 2 years later, I was using the fan for a makeup look and couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that I was being watched. So in a very cliché horror movie fashion, I said, &quot;If there&#39;s anyone here, flash these lights.&quot; And as soon as the words came out of my mouth, the lights started flashing like crazy. So yeah that pretty much confirmed it for me.  I tucked the fan away in some old boxes and hadn&#39;t thought about it for a while, when recently, now another 2 years later, things started getting crazy again. I was home alone cooking dinner one night, and suddenly the cutting board that I had been using went flying off the counter. Then a few minutes later, the stove turned on and nearly caught something on fire.</p>

<p>After that, not wanting to risk allowing things to escalate, I burned most of the fan and threw it away. Things have been normal ever since.</p>

<p>My father killed him self 3 years ago, he was a gamer like I am, Halloween night was the night things first started happening, the only thing that had changed in the first year following his death was the curtains, i didn’t go trick or treating so i went to bed, I woke up to get a glass of water and right in front of me the curtains and the rod they were on were ripped off the wall, confused and scared about what happened I stare at the spot for about 2 minutes, then the garage door opened and closed (the garage was his favorite place to play video games), I could hear my mother snoring in her room, I went back to bed, the next day I was playing video games, I got tired, turned everything off and started drifting to sleep, but my console and tv turned back on, I looked for the remote and controller and they were on the dresser across the room, nothing was by my gaming setup that could’ve pressed either button, I turned everything off again and went back to bed, that night I had my worst lucid night terror ever, 
In the morning I woke up to my console and tv on, my father’s favorite game running, and a male character on screen, his character name was Excalibur, it was my father’s gaming name, i never set up male characters, the next few nights were more lucid terrors and hearing my father whisper inaudible things, it all seemed in my head until one morning when my mother said “were you talking to someone last night? He seemed a bit old to be playing video games” I explained everything to her that’s happened and she took me to a psychiatrist, the meds I’ve been given don’t do anything, I’m on the highest doses to “ensure the effect”
 I have no mental conditions but now I see things that “aren’t there” including my father, turning on the console and tv
right in front of me, and logging into his favorite game.

<p>I was probably about 10 when this happened. I woke up in the middle of the night to a tapping sound. In my room I had a wall dedicated to two sliding doors for my wardrobe that were also mirrors. I thought the noise was just in my head (I used to wake up to noises that weren&#39;t even there as well)  so I decided to close my eyes and go back to sleep. But then it happened again but this time it was two knocks, as if someone was politely knocking on the door...except it had that strange reverb my mirrors made when they hit the walls. I pinched myself to make sure I was awake and my skin hurt, so I thought I was awake. I refused to move and I remember my body aching because of how tightly I was tensing all of my muscles. The knocking continued...tap tap tap tap...tap tap tap tap...and then it stopped. As my body began relaxing I started to breathe a bit easier thinking it had gone away...
Then BANG! It sounded as though whatever it was had slammed a fist or a heavy object against the mirrors and I was once again curled into a ball and crying, thinking to myself &quot;it knows I&#39;m awake, it knows I can hear it&quot;. The banging continued louder and louder, not stopping, or at least I don&#39;t remember it stopping. I wanted to call out to my mum in the next room but it was as though my throat wouldn&#39;t let me make any noise. I clutched my pillow and cried and cried. I don&#39;t remember going to sleep but I remember waking up, still in a ball and my pillow damp from tears. </p>

<p>I told this story in an English class where the teacher wanted us to tell our scariest experiences. One girl started crying and the teacher tried to put it down to the wind shaking the glass. Even on the windiest nights nothing like this had every happened. To this day I&#39;ve had no other way to explain it other than a night terror :)</p>

That high school is one of the oldest high schools in my city and there are rumors of being haunted.</p>

<p>One night, we went just to see some cheerleaders practice. We were unsure were their practice location was and we were lost at the school hallway. </p>

<p>Out of nowhere, a girl around 9 years old came out of a dark room and ask if we were lost. We said yes and she claimed she could help us. We told her what was she doing at the room alone, she said her mom worked there. We ignored it and asked her why we were there. 
She was kind enough to lead us where it was and even opened the door for us. </p>

<p>We said thanks and continued our way. When it was done, we headed back the way we arrived and saw a janitor. We told him goodbye and to let the girl know she helped us a lot. The janitor asked what we were talking about and we explained. </p>

<p>He sighed and told us firmly that no one besides the cheerleader team were at the school. There was no way a kid could&#39;ve been here. 
We froze in confusion and he seemed to know we got scared. He then told us to ignore it had happened and guided us to the door. </p>

<p>Till this day, I am still confused. But a teacher who once worked there told me he knew who I was talking about. Apparently a girl haunts the first floor of the high school and he has even met her.</p>

<p>I usually don’t go on reddit. At all really, but I figured I could share my “spooky” story with everyone.
It started in 1st grade, my first sleepover actually. My two friends and I were hanging out in my living room when one of my friends said that a halloween decoration moved on its own. Of course it didn’t but my gullible young self believed so. I hated that decoration ever since. (<a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/dd/0d/95/dd0d95d25ee7d779ba70233d1864550b.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/dd/0d/95/dd0d95d25ee7d779ba70233d1864550b.jpg</a> it was this one actually. My grandma actually had the same one) 
I begged my mom to let it stay in the basement during October and I always hated going into the basement to get anything. I always thought it was watching me. It terrified me. 
Fast forward to 6th grade, and yes I’m still scared of it. 
I’d usually stay up till 3am on my phone, talking with friends and such. I’d turn it off, tuck it under my pillow and fall asleep. One night I saw something come into my bedroom and slowly stand up in the corner of my wall. It was almost as tall as my door. It slowly turned its head and looked at me. I was so terrified I couldn’t move. It was black, skinny, and it had a smile on its face whenever it looked at me. 
Sometimes it would slowly slink to the floor and crawl around on all fours. It would climb onto my beanbag chair and stare at me till I hid under my covers. 
When I was about to go to sleep, i felt it sit on my bed. I looked, nothing was there but there was an indent of a person there. ten minutes later I feel breathing against my neck and it talked. It sounded like a male in his late twenties, “Please don’t sleep.” I almost pulled an all nighter that night.
Months went on and it did the same thing, moved around, touched me, moved my hair, said short sentences. 
One day I decided to pull a fast one on this mother fucker and start talking to it. I sat up and tried starting a conversation. It never really talked back but I knew it was listening to me because itd always stare right into my eyes.
I decided to name it Bob. I told him my problems because he was the only one who would listen. 
I’d draw him, tell him jokes, tell him how my day was. Then I thought it’d be funny if Bob was actually the Halloween decoration. It made me bit less uneasy so whenever I went into the basement I’d talk to that too. 
This went on till 7th grade, I had a house fire. A year later I came back to my original house. Bob was gone. I was devastated really. I grew such a connection with him and I never really got to say goodbye. But I was also scared of losing Bob 2.0. A few weeks of unpacking and I finally found him. I yanked him out and cried cause I had missed him so much. My mother looked at me like I was crazy. But that was alright. 
I decided to keep Bob 2.0 in my room with me, and I put him right where Bob used to be. 
Now I’m 16 and he’s still there. My friends are usually scared to sleep in my room with him but I usually force him. I don’t like putting him in the closet cause he’d be lonely.
Sometimes during the night I hear my door open and close. I’ve also noticed that Bob 2.0’s head turned just a bit more towards me just to watch me on my chair. </p>

<p>I’d like to say that Bob helped me though a lot and he’s a pretty grand guy for doing what he did</p>

So in my childhood home my bedroom was located at the very end of the hall and the bathroom was located beside my bedroom. So if you were standing in front of the bedroom door the bathroom was on the left side. Because of this I could see the light from the bathroom on my bedroom door whenever my door was open and I could see shadows of people whenever they would go to the bathroom. Anyways one night I heard my father pause the TV and walk down the hall. I could then see his shadow go into the bathroom and close the door. When he was done he opened the door and I could see the shadow of a man again on my bedroom door and then I heard him walk back down the hall and turn the TV back on in the living room. The creepy thing was was that his shadow did not move. There was still the shadow of a man on my bedroom door. It stayed there for like 5 minutes, at least it felt that long, and then just moved away as if it was going back down the hallway. I slept with the door closed after that.</p>

My dad had died a few months after I was born and he was a big Scooby doo fan... like he loved it</p>

<p>I did not remember if me and him ever watched it or something (I was literally a few months old)</p>

<p>One day I was at elementary school (yea this story is a good few years back) and me and my friends where playing on the playground... one of them said a little parody of the Scooby doo intro ( I can’t remember the words but I know it made fun of the show, in a not good way) I of course never watching the show and having nothing against a little fun joined in on it and repeated it  over and over for the rest of the day, let’s cut to night time... I fall asleep and wake up in the middle of the night feeling kinda cold even under the covers... I sit there trying to sleep and all of a sudden one of my stuffed animals got thrown at me from the other side of the room... I sat there in fear and shock for the rest of the night..... I never made fun of Scooby doo again and actually love the show too... I’m not sure if it was my dad’s ghost who did it or what... </p>

<p>My younger brother is firmly convinced that my mom’s house is haunted. During the first or second summer that my mom had the house, he would sleep exclusively in the basement.</p>

<p>None of the things that he said happened were too out of the ordinary. The door to the basement bathroom closed on its own (which I already knew it was prone to doing - it’s weighted or something so it will close if it’s left open), the motion/movement sensing light on the TV remote turning on without anyone moving it, toy cars apparently moving by themselves on the carpeted floor, et cetera. He watched a lot of “scary” YouTube videos (think like 3 AM challenges - he was genuinely terrified of them) so I just chalked it up to an overactive imagination.</p>

<p>The things that have happened to me are a little stranger. The bedroom that I use has the entryway to the attic in it (I know, basements and attics are classic horror movie no-no’s), and I usually have to share it with my stepsisters. The weird/unexplainable things only ever happen when I’m alone, though (again with the horror movie tropes). Plus, they’re mainly auditory. I don’t think I’ve actually seen anything happen at my mom’s house.</p>

<p>The first thing that I can remember happening to me was right before I was trying to go to sleep. I had my eyes closed and was laying on the right side of the bed, which was the side not blocked by the wall. All was well and peaceful. I suddenly heard someone whisper “Please” directly into my right ear. The gripping feeling of dread and my heart pounding made me think <em>“Nope nope nope nope nope”</em> and as quickly as possible I moved over to the wall.</p>

<p>I have also heard tapping in my room at night from my brothers’ closet because our closets share a wall and have heard their tub of Bionicles and Legos being sifted through when no one is in their room. I stayed at my mom’s house for the entirety of last summer and was left alone in the house while she and her husband were at work. I had this constant feeling that someone was watching me as I went around the house to do stuff, and that feeling only amplified when I was in my room. I usually ended up staying in the living room with the dogs and cat, which made that feeling somewhat subside.</p>

<p>I try to be rational about stuff like this, but I really don’t know what could have caused this stuff, especially the whole hearing someone say “please” while I’m alone thing. My older brother, sister, and stepsisters haven’t experienced anything and I don’t know about my mom or her husband. It’s just me and my younger brother, I guess.</p>

For context of how they have effected me, I have night terrors a lot and scream and kick in my sleep. For some pretext, I believe in ghosts due to events that have occurred in my life but don&#39;t expect anyone else to.</p>

<p>When I was around 13 I woke up to what I thought was a shake of my bed it could have been just me shaking and my sleeping brain overreacting. I then turned from my side on to my back and was met with what looked like a deformed face slightly above me. I was immediately in a state of shock and fear because it was clearly about 1 ft above me and it disappear for a good 10 or 15 seconds. As soon as it did I ran downstairs where my mom was still awake and explained to her what happened. I have had several ghost like experiences happen in my starting when I was 5 after the death of my great grandmother and my mom understood. I refused for years to sleep in my own room and instead slept down on my couch for most of my teenage years all the way until about the end of my senior year. And the thing that solidified my fear happened about a month or so after the original event. I was sitting in my room and playing video games after school and I saw something strange out of the corner of my go into my sister&#39;s room, which the door and just into her room could be seen from the angle I was at in my room. I turned to see of my sister was home but I didnt hear her somehow. I was then met with am arm stick out of her room and a long finger beckoning me to come closer and then it pulled back into her room. I sat totally still and silent for several minutes maybe almost even up to an hour because I wanted to leave my room desperately but my sister&#39;s door was literally on step outside of my door, so leaving my room would mean going right past the where I just saw. I would run by the door and sprint downstairs to my family where I sat quietly while they were trying to figure out what happened. The resolution of this story comes another couple months later where we replaced all the windows in the house. My dad&#39;s friend was doing it for us so after all the windows in the house where removed my dad walked through the house asking whatever was there to leave. We didnt really experience anything like that again. My parents and sister had experienced a few minorly aggressive unexplainable event before then, and didnt really after. For me I never saw the face or the arm again in my consciousness, but I still see the face when I close my eyes or try to go to sleep sometimes. I wont even be thinking about it. It just happens because my subconscious is traumatized still.</p>

<p>Btw this was not sleep paralysis I could move I just was too scared to when I turned over and saw the monster thingy.</p>

<p>The looking man</p>

<p>I personally have a very small room I usually can see all of my surroundings and what’s around me. In my room I have a little corner, which I can’t see what’s behind it.  </p>

<p>One day I woke up in the middle of the night and I swore in the dark I could see someone peeking around the corner looking at me just staring. At the time being a 13 year old who tends to be scared of the dark I just laid there petrified staring at that thing staring back at me. I didn’t know what to do I was terrified I couldn’t tell if it was a human being staring at me, my imagination, or a creature. </p>

<p>I continued staring until it just seemed to slip away and I don’t know how I managed to fall asleep that night. But In the morning all I knew was there was no way that thing was human.</p>

<p>That night my mom woke up to voices in the living room. When she got to the living room she saw me sitting on the couch laughing and having a conversation like someone was there. My mom asked me &quot;What are you doing out of bed?&quot;</p>

<p>My mom everytime she tells me this story says that I didn&#39;t say anything, I just went back to bed like nothing happened.</p>

<p>I always can&#39;t believe my mom when she tells me this story. I remember being afraid of the dark when I was little. How could I have the courage to get up out of bed and sit myself in the living room alone in the dark?</p>

<p>I will never know.</p>

<p>Some pretty weird shit has happened around my neighborhood— One summer I found three or four squirrel corpses close to my house. One was missing it’s eyes, and I could see bees nesting in its skull cavity. More gruesome than creepy, but the whole thing was quite unsettling. </p>

<p>One morning I walked out in the field in my backyard to find a five by five perfect square of burnt grass. I still have no idea how it happened. </p>

<p>Probably the creepiest thing—</p>

<p>My room is in the basement of my house, halfway underground. I have one window, and it rests at ground level, just above my bed. Sometimes I sleep with the shades open, sometimes I don’t. </p>

<p>One night, I woke up, thinking I had heard something. Light was shining through my window, and I stared at the wall across from my bed as I realized I saw the shadow of a human figure, just crouched outside my window. </p>

<p>I don’t remember much else, I probably just froze up or went back to bed. </p>

<p>Ever since then, I’ve always kept my window locked at night. There have been a few times where a stray cat will creep around outside my window and it terrifies me, because i remember this encounter.</p>

<p>When I was around 7-9 years old, I lived with my grandparents for a bit because there were some problems at home. Keep in mind they lived out in the middle of nowhere on a cranberry marsh in Wisconsin. So my grandpa got up pretty early to tend to that stuff.
I woke up to a loud bang in a dark house (it had to have been around 4 am). I figured it was just grandpa stomping around getting ready. So I decided to get some water from the kitchen and see what he was doing. 
I walk into an empty kitchen and see a very large black bear on the other side of the sliding glass door. He was just vibin on the deck. So naturally, I climbed into the bed of my grandparent&#39;s big ass golden retriever and fell asleep. 
When I woke up my grandma asked wtf I was doing sleeping in the dog bed. I explained what I saw and she replied, &quot;oh, he comes by every night. He usually sleeps outside of your room&quot;. </p>

<p>WHY WOULD YOU TELL ME THAT</p>

Here&#39;s mine:
so this may be long so bear with me ok. This is the story of my old home that I think was haunted.</p>

<p>So when I was younger my older sisters door was right next door to mine and I could kinda see into it from certain angles. I used to pace my room thinking and a bunch of the time, I would see a man standing in my sister&#39;s door he was tall wore a trench coat and hat I would see him alot but I was always to scared to say anything to my sister. Until one day when she brought up seeing things as well and I told her about the man I always say in her door and she told me that she had seen him to. So me and my sister told my mom and she said that she had saw this man as well. Now we were obviously scared that something had attached itself to my sister but after we talked about it, I never really saw him again although I always felt like I was being watched.
Another time me and my sister were in her room together and she had gotten a helium ballon for her birthday and it was chilling on her room. Now me and my sister were sitting together when the ballon slowly started to make its way over to my sister which creeped us out so we moved it and it again started to move towards my sister. So at this point we called our mom down and she put it in her closet and we started to talk when all of a sudden it started to come out, of the closet and ONCE AGAIN TOWARDS MY SISTER. So this time we put it in the laundry room (our laundry room didn&#39;t have a door) we thought that it wa over and nothing happened for the rest of that day (or it was that day I don&#39;t remember) me and my sister once again were chilling and the ballon came out of the laundry room and towards her so this time to be safe we tied the ballon into the laundry room and popped it but left it incase the thing wanted it. 
Now I didn&#39;t really have anything else happen to me in that house but one time my sister walked up stairs (our rooms were in the basement) and the a cabinet in our kitchen opened (I don&#39;t remember exactly what she told me but it was along those lines).
Now I am going to stop there because there Is just so many creepy things that happened in that house and to my family like my sister seeing my dead great grandfather when she was a child. But long story short we moved houses but I still think something may of followed us to this new house.</p>

<p>So I sleep over at my best friends house all the time, we’ve been best friends for going on 14 years now, and this happened probably when we were 16 or 17 I think?
So she has a pullout bed that goes next to hers, and we sometimes switch which one we sleep on. That night, I slept on the bed closest to the farthest wall from the closet, and she slept on the outside bed.</p>

<p>I mentioned the closet because this is the creepiest closet I’ve ever seen in my life. It sits right in the corner of the room, the light from the window hits the door just right to where you can’t see inside, and the door cannot shut, it always stays slightly open. Now back to our tale of horror.</p>

<p>My friend has always talked in her sleep, but it’s always been simple nonsense. Random words, some gibberish here and there, but she doesn’t do it often, and it never makes sense.
She always goes to sleep before I do, and I can always tell when she’s sleeping, as her breath pattern changes and becomes deeper and slowed. She was asleep, I had checked, but I was quietly listening to music, or watching one of Mark’s videos, I can’t remember.
Suddenly, she sits bolt upright, like her body was suddenly full of electricity. Humans usually don’t sit at a perfect ninety degree angle with their legs out in front of them.</p>

<p>I immediately stopped what I was doing and looked at her. “Hey [bestie]? You awake?”
No response.
I listened to her breathing, still slowed and deep, her eyes still shut, facing forward. She was still asleep.
I sat as still as I could, slightly worried. But as soon as I thought I maybe should lay her back down, her head started to turn. Slowly, it turned until she was directly looking at me, but her eyes were closed the whole time. Still the same slow deep breaths.
One second.
Two seconds.
Silence.
And then,</p>

<p>“...watch out for.. that man in the corner.” As her arm raised up, hand outstretched toward the closet.</p>

<p>And as quickly as she sat up, she fell back down with her head in the pillow, breathing as calmly as she had the whole time, eyes still closed.
I didn’t sleep that night.</p>

<p>I asked her about it in the morning, and she had absolutely no recollection of what I was talking about, and told me that she had slept wonderfully.</p>

<p>I still don’t go near the closet.</p>

<p>I was 16 at the time and I was just starting my sophomore year of highschool. It was late at night about 9:30, My mom told me to &quot;Take out the recycle &quot; (it was my normal weekly chore) As I was taking it to the side of my house. Also the side of my house gets ZERO light at night. I put the the shet it the recycle bin and started walking back in side the I heard the bush next to me start to rustle. I turned on my phone light and looked around the Bush. I saw a man in all black crouching behind the bush..so naturally.... I FRIGGIN BOLTED. But it didn&#39;t end there</p>

<p>As the month continued I always had the feeling that I was being watched. So the week after it happend I was in my bunk bed (if that&#39;s what you want to call it)  and I looked out my window next to me and low and behold. It was him the same man. But he was at my window looking up at me. He was a tall lanky man and his nose barely poked through his hood. He was staring right at me. I screamed, waking up my brother and dad. My dad grabbed his bat, I grabbed my Bowie knife. And my brother grabbed his ak-47 airsoft gun. We stepped into the night and I saw him running down the street. My brother shot at him...and missed. So my dad called the cops and....they....found....not a single darn thing. The same thing repeated over...and over..and over.</p>

<p>April hit and the man...stopped showing up. Normally that would be a good thing, but no. I knew something was up and my house was non-stop creaking at night. I was up all the time barely sleeping. Around 3:4...7 sure 3:47 AM, I woke up to my door creaking open. I woke up and stared at him... the man. He was in my house staring at me. I jumped from my top bunk and threw my office chair at him ....AND I HIT THAT MOTHER TRUCKER. He bolted and ran out of my house through the front door. Also just a little side note. I broke his arm. My dad waited until the following night and he called the cops around 2 AM. He told the the whole deal and the cops (FINALLY) wasted no time getting to our house. My dad told them be approach as quiet as they could. So they came ...as quiet as a mouse. I heard my roof squeaking, squealing, and creaking..and I knew. Iij whispered to the cops &quot;He is in the attic&quot; they open the attic door and they moved up onto the attic and I heard one scream and I heard the normal &quot; GET DOWN ON THE GROUND NOW&quot; after about 10 minutes they brought him down. The cops also told us that if looked like he was living in m th attic for about a year. The man spoke up and said &quot;2 ya f@%ken moron&quot; the man was escorted from my house into a patrol vehicle. My dad and I went into the attic and we saw.... his clothes, things that he was stealing from all of my family members. Drilled holes above each room, a rag with...man juice on it. A blood stained sleeping bag, a cooler, and....</p>

<p>A clean set of knives...with tags of each of my family members names (crudely written with blood) ...including mine. In court he made sure to get the point across that it was his plan to murder all of us with a different knife but he was going to steal all of our personal and expensive belongings first. The only thing stopping him from finishing it was me. Me being a female he also said that if I didn&#39;t break his arm that night, he said and I quote, &quot;would have f@$%ed me like there was no tomorrow and after he was done...he&#39;d slit my throat and kill my little brother and my baby brother.&quot; Also he said that my family  wasn&#39;t the only ones that this happend to he sa im d the he was stalking every girl in the neighborhood so....that&#39;s nice. He is now safely behind bars and it&#39;s gonna stay that way</p>

<p>Just for some back ground, I live in Florida, in a 3 story apartment on the top floor. Our apartment is on the corner and I have the front corner room, so I leave my screened in windows open a lot. One of them won&#39;t shut fully though, leaves about a 4 inch gap. There&#39;s a canal in the back of the building. 
So a few months back, it had been relatively chilly, but we were getting a rain storm. Because of the cold air (I&#39;m a floridian and anything under 70°F is cold), I had my windows shut (other than the broken one). However, since the rain was coming, it&#39;d get warmer and there tends to be more movement of the air outside. It started pouring and I was sitting in my bed, which is next to the broken window. I started to vaguely smell something. I couldn&#39;t put my finger on what it was though. I got up and had my mom sit where I was- she couldn&#39;t smell anything and told me it was likely the canal in the back. I thought it was strange because in all the years I had lived there, I never smelt that. It gets to be later and I&#39;m getting ready to sleep, watching YouTube and I smell it again on and off. I figured out that it smelled like a landfill. This made sense to be the canal because I&#39;d smelled something similar by other ones before- but again, never at my apartment at the farthest point away from it, with just a cracked window that faced away. </p>

<p>The next day came and I couldn&#39;t smell it anymore. I was leaving for work and I happen to look at my downstairs neighbor&#39;s window and there were two flies near it. Only by their window, which was the second floor, which was odd. I didn&#39;t think much of it, so I went on my merry way. Went to work and forgot about it, got home that night- no smell, no bugs anywhere. When I was laying in my bed, I thought I smelt it once and then happened to look up what smells like dumps. Dead bodies do. At some point after that really soon I fell asleep. 
I woke up to screaming about calling 911. Apparently, my downstairs neighbor died on the floor of his apartment in the room right under mine. He&#39;d been left there for at least 5 days and I had been smelling his body decomposing below me. He was 49, on house arrest, nobody liked him so nobody would&#39;ve known had his sister not went to get his mother clothes because a few weeks prior they&#39;d moved her out of the apartment with him into a nursing home. I couldn&#39;t sleep for weeks.</p>

<p>This happened roughly four years ago when I was 11. At the time I lived with my father, my aunt, and my older sister in a two-bedroom house with a decent sized yard. To understand this story I need to give a little bit of a layout of the house. I&#39;ll make it as quick and as brief as possible.</p>

<p>So when you walk through the front door there&#39;s the living room,  if you walk to the right there&#39;s a small hallway that leads to the rooms. Down the right was the room I shared with my sister, in front was my aunt&#39;s room, and to the left was the bathroom. In front of the living room was the kitchen and in the kitchen, there was a side door that leads to the outside.</p>

<p>So into the story. No one else was home, my sister was at her friends and my aunt was also with a friend. My dad was out somewhere, probably clubbing or getting high, nothing new to me. Neither was being left home alone, I was old enough to fend for myself.</p>

<p>It was late and I was just twiddling on my iPad. Nothing seemed off. But then, I heard knocking on my window. I wasn&#39;t sure what it was or if I was really hearing it but after it persisted for a few seconds I decided to peek through my blinds. The reason red flags didn&#39;t initially go of was because I thought my dad had left/lost his key (he&#39;s dumb it&#39;s happened before) and needed me to open the door (he&#39;s usually too drunk to think to call).</p>

<p>However, what I saw freaked me out. Outside of my window was a dark figure. It looked to be a man by the silhouette but I couldn&#39;t see the details of his face because of how dark it was. I was fucking <em>horrified</em>. When I peeked, the tapping persisted so I assumed he hadn&#39;t seen me. I prayed he hadn&#39;t seen me. After a minute of knocking, it stopped and I was relieved. He left.</p>

<p>I was wrong. Because the walls of this house were so paper thin, I heard him start to knock on one of the windows in the living room. Then he moved on to jiggle the doorknob and knocked there, then he knocked on the other two living room windows (which were quite high from the floor), then he jiggled the doorknob and knocked on the side door, and finally knocked on the kitchen window. From there he did it all again, but backward. Starting from the kitchen and working his way back.</p>

<p>I had never been so scared in my entire life. Well, at least not from something directly affecting me. I had no idea what to do so I started calling my dad. He usually didn&#39;t answer his phone when he was out at night and this time was no different. But I was so paralyzed with fear that all I could do was call and call and call. After calling him too many times to count, he finally picked up.  He started to yell but I cut him off, immediately telling him what was going on.</p>

<p>He was shocked and we talked for a few more seconds before he told me not to make a sound and that he was on his way home. The man outside continued to tap all windows and shake all doorknobs repeatedly and he ended up doing it a few times over. My dad finally arrived and I could hear him yelling at the guy. The police came and after half an hour my dad went inside the house. I asked what happened and turns out it was one of his druggie friends which he told to leave before the police got there (he called them prior to showing up, before he realized who it was)</p>

<p>So yeah, that&#39;s my scary story. Sorry it was so long!</p>

<p>Tl;Dr an ominous figure knocked on all my doors and windows, turns out it was a crackhead</p>

Anyway one night my parents are away since they go camping and on sports trips a lot. I’m fast asleep not really dreaming of anything I can remember when I’m half pulled from sleep by... </p>

<p>something...</p>

<p>I don’t know why but I’m awake, WIDE awake, but as I lay there I hear it from outside my window, a noise a terrifying;</p>

<p>Shrrrrk. ... shrrrrrk ... shrrrrrrrrk.</p>

<p>A horrible scraping noise from outside my window. It’s getting closer and louder. There’s a small gap between each noise creating just enough time to really cause visceral fear through my whole body. I’m trembling and shaking but I convince myself I have to see what it is. A murderer? Some sort of eldritch beast?? What is it? Whatever it was I was convinced it was dangerous. </p>

<p>Shrrrrk. Shrrrk.</p>

<p>It’s still going, I’m terrified, I’ve never heard this noise before in my life. So I climb to the edge of my bed and shakily pull back the edge of my curtain, exposing as little of my body as possible. I can’t see much because of the external blind but I can make out a small dark shape moving on my driveway. Shrrk. Shrrrrrk. SHRRRK. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>It’s my cat. She’s ‘caught’ a wet plastic bag from the nearby drain and is dragging it home. Making a horrible wet scrapping noise ever time she pulls it. It’s too heavy for her so she has to keep stopping to Re-grab it. Never in my life I’ve been so scared and it was my cat and a plastic bag.</p>

<p>One night when I was about 15 or 16, I went to bed and fell asleep. I didn&#39;t take any medications, didn&#39;t do anything different than normal. I proceeded to have the longest, most vivid dream of my life.</p>

<p>I woke up in a white room, evenly lit with no visible light source so shadows were barely visible. Everything in this room was white and made of the same eerily frictionless plastic, even the cushions on the couch I woke up on. There was a desk full of blank white books and white pens with white ink. There was a small workbench with a shallow box of plastic play tools. There were no sharp corners on anything, it was all rounded out, and the furniture merged with the floor and walls so it couldn&#39;t be moved.</p>

<p>Then I discovered that even my skin was pure white. Hair and fingernails too. My clothing was soft and white, and didn&#39;t make any noise when it moved or rubbed against itself. Nothing did. I could slap my hand down on the desk or floor and there would be no sound. The only thing that made sound was me. I could talk or sing or hum, clap my hands or snap my fingers. I began doing this immediately, just to fill the unnerving silence.</p>

<p>There was no way out of this room.</p>

<p>Food was delivered to me in a small section of the room that had shifting walls. Whenever I was hungry I would walk into the small maze and find a bowl of white paste. It smelled of nothing and tasted the way wet plaster smells. I never had to relieve myself, I remember thinking that it was odd. I never drank water or anything. Just that awful paste.</p>

<p>I can still remember every day. Gradually going insane in this little white room, days upon days upon days of sensory deprivation that felt like my eyes and ears were stuffed with cotton.</p>

<p>I spent every moment talking or singing to myself, trying to stay sane. When my voice gave out I would use my hands to make some kind of sound. A few times I managed to destroy the couch cushions or crack the drawers in the desk; they would be back to normal the next time I slept and woke up.</p>

<p>I remember fixing the image of a rainbow in my mind, and it was as important to me as the faces of my family. Gradually the faces faded, though I remembered their names. I remembered the rainbow, but forgot the names of the colors. I cried whenever I failed to remember the name of a color.</p>

<p>This went on for so, so long. By the time something different happened, I was almost completely insane. I was spending my days slowly turning the pages of the blank books, staring at them for hours before turning to the next.</p>

<p>Then one day, I got a paper cut.</p>

<p>A tiny drop of blood welled up on my finger. I stared at it in awe; it was the most beautiful thing I&#39;d ever seen. By reflex I stuck my finger in my mouth and almost choked. This was the most I had tasted, most I had seen, most I had felt in forever. I started weeping when I looked at my finger again and was able to remember a single word. Red. It bought me a few more days of sanity. Whenever I felt like I was slipping I would get the book out and try to cut myself again. I knew that hurting myself was bad, but my eyes were so starved, so desperate for anything but white.</p>

<p>At this point I had stopped trying to fill every moment with noise. My mind was quiet like everything else. Until I pulled out one of the books again to cut myself on the paper; I was slowly turning pages when a song began playing in my head. I hummed it automatically, and felt curious and confused, because I had never heard it before. Then a flash of color in the book catches my eye. I turn it sideways and practically break the spine to read the tiny red words written in the fold between pages. &quot;The name of the song is Welcome Home.&quot; I blinked. The next moment I was opening my eyes in my bedroom at home, the next morning.</p>

<p>This dream was so traumatic that my parents noticed a definite personality change. Luckily my dad is a talented mental health counselor and was able to help me get over it fairly quickly, though it has continued to impact me even to this day, years later.</p>

<p>The most unexplainable, scary part happened about two weeks after the dream. The tune I had heard just before waking was still fresh in my mind. I was still upset immensely by thoughts of the dream. I was watching television with my siblings when a trailer for the movie &#39;9&#39; came on, and the music was the same as the song in my dream. I about had a heart attack. I frantically grabbed a laptop and looked up the trailer, and the name of the song used in it.</p>

<p>When I was a little kid maybe 3 or 4, I had an imaginary &quot;friend&quot;. I mainly saw it at night, very few times in my dreams (which is way I thought it was sleep paralysis for the longest time.) One night my siblings, my mom, and I were asleep in the living room, waiting for my dad to get home to surprise him. In my sleep, I had a feeling I was being watched so I woke up. I saw my dad coming up the driveway since I could see through the front window and I was about to get up to run to the back door( he always came in through the back door at night) and I saw it. </p>

<p>My imaginary &quot;friend&quot; stood there in the living room, slightly in the corner and ever so slightly in front of the door that leads to the kitchen, which of course leads to the back door. I looked at it with shock and mind-numbing fear as I studied its features. It was wide. Wide enough to potentially block the entire doorway and then some. It was pitch black like a shadow, but I could tell that it was wearing a large thick hood over its long and pointed face. I looked down at its feet and saw that there were none. Just a long misty looking torn robe that shifted back and forth like tentacles. That is when I hear my mom whisper from the other couch, &quot;Shhh. It&#39;s okay. Just ignore him and he&#39;ll leave you alone.&quot; </p>

<p>A few moments after this my dad came in. He said hi to my mom and went to do his laundry as quietly as he could. I watched as my &quot;friend&quot; turned its attention to my dad. Me, still being a scared kid, ran after my dad so he could protect me. I did what my mom said to do and did not look at it as I left. When my dad and I snuggled together to fall asleep, the last thing I see before drifting off into dreamland is the tall dark figure very very slowly float into the room.</p>

<p>Years later when I turned 16, my mom and I were talking about &quot;scary&quot; ghost stories when I brought my     &quot;friend&quot;. I at this point, I thought that I had horrifying dreams when my mom said, &quot; Nope. He was very real.&quot; Then she proceeded to explain exactly what he looked like, even told me of her own encounter with it. I am not going to lie here, I actually started balling because for years I thought I was crazy, then convinced myself it was a dream all while never telling anyone what I went through. I&#39;m not crazy, and I never was. I&#39;m happy that I&#39;m not, but I hate that it actually happened. I think the worst part is, is that we found out why it was there. I&#39;m so glad it&#39;s gone.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Turns out my sleep paralysis demon was actually there.</p>

It&#39;s spooky, maybe not &quot;scary&quot; but more like &quot;yo wtf am I seeing?&quot;. I can&#39;t remember where it was exactly, but it was in the Japanese tea garden area within a larger park/garden. Now, there was a series of ponds throughout the tea garden, and they were populated with Koi fish. I crouched down to look at them, while a young man (maybe early/mid 20&#39;s) did the same thing. What I noticed is that he was looking very intensely at one Koi fish and was slowly extending his hand toward the water. I thought, maybe he&#39;s trying to scare it, who knows. I glance back to the fish I was looking at, and then back at the man. I can&#39;t really figure out what&#39;s happening at first, but then I realize that a dozen or so Koi fish have gathered around his hand, which is now partly submerged in the water. I look at what he&#39;s doing with his hand in the water only to see that he is PETTING THE FISH LIKE YOU WOULD A CAT OR DOG. It clicks, and I realize the other fish are gathering and circling around his hand in an attempt to gain his attention so he will pet them too. I mean, I thought this guy was some kind of sage, or attuned to nature on a spiritual level. I&#39;ve never seen anything like that since.</p>

But when a relative died we received a piece of furniture from them (as well as a few other bits but this stood out). From that moment on we received episodes of... How do I put this? “Spooky Shit”... things such as the lights going on and off, things falling, things breaking etc. But the worse parts where the nightmares. More specifically MY night terrors. Now I apparently had quite a few and still do to this day (I’m 17) 
But a few when I were young were supposedly related to this figure. One night I was screaming as if I was being attacked. My mum came bursting into my room and I apparently screamed to them the room is burning and there’s someone coming from the wall, my mum was too scared to turn round to which she shouted for help from other family members in the house. After all this she locked the piece of furniture away out of our house. And all the episodes of terrors,strangeness etc. 
All stopped</p>

<p>My scariest experience happened a few years ago. I was around 10. My sister woke me up in the middle of the night, gave me a blank stare, and said, &quot;did you hear that&quot;? I asked &quot;hear what?&quot; and she said &quot;the scrathcing on the door. I froze for a few seconds and just calmed her down and we went back to sleep. Then, at about 4am, I woke up to the sound of something scrathcing at the door to our bedroom. I just panicked, and woke her up. I told her &quot;I heard it&quot; and then she reasured me that it was nothing, and we both fall asleep. To this day, I still can&#39;t explain what happened. There were no scratch marks on the door in the morning, and we don&#39;t have pets at my grandma&#39;s house. My grandfather had just passed away a few weeks ago, so we though it was his ghost reaching out to us. Then the light in the big bedroom started to go off on it&#39;s own (no one uses the big bedroom anymore, neither did anyone use it back then). So many times, I go to the big bedroom, and see the light switch in the down position, and the light on. The light switches aren&#39;t one of those that you can have two in the same room and have both control the lights at the same time. It&#39;s just that one. On it&#39;s own. That also scares the piss out of me.</p>

<p>So in one of my old houses I often saw this apparition of a little girl named Vanessa. She had dirty brown hair and an older styled purple dress. 
So one day I was in my room that I shared with my little sister, and I heard a female voice calling my name from outside the window. I look outside and didn&#39;t see anything. So i sad on my bed again. But my name was called again so i glanced outside and shouted lut the window for my sister to knock it off. I was annoyed till i remembered my little sister wasnt home at the time. Me having watched ghost shows  went outside to investigate. The voice led me to the wood where i saw tje most gruesome scene ever. The little girl way laying across a big rock where me and my neighbor often played at. A tall man was standing over her with a knife i think in his hand. The little girl was cut open and bleeding out and no longer moving. The man noticing me turned and came running at me.  I ran away screaming. I&#39;ve never run faster in my life. my step dad ended up finding me when i stepped out of those woods. </p>

We live in Minnesota and we stay at this place called Hart Ranch, where you can rent a cabin or bring a camper or RV and rent a spot for it.</p>

<p>The last time we went there, I was about 13 and it was just me and my grandpa, so we rented the smallest cabin you could get (1 bed, 1 bath, a tiny kitchen and a living room with just a couch, chair, and TV). One night, I couldn&#39;t fall asleep, and since I was sleeping on the couch, I grabbed one of the keys and my iPod off of the kitchen table, put on my flip-flops, and started walking around outside.</p>

<p>At one point, I felt like I was being watched, so I looked around to see if there were any animals or anything that I could see. There weren&#39;t.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I see bright lights flash on behind me and I hear the sound of a car starting. I crossed to the other side of the &quot;street,&quot; assuming that this person was leaving to go somewhere. They weren&#39;t. I kept walking, and for about 10 more minutes, I heard the car behind me. Now, the cabins are arranged in a similar way to a city, with &quot;blocks&quot; with 3-5 cabins on each side of the roads. I had earbuds in, but I had paused my music so I could hear better.</p>

<p>I walked around the same block of cabins a couple times, trying to act like I couldn&#39;t remember which on was mine, while I was actually trying to see if this car was following me. And it did. So I stopped, knelt down to make it look like I was tying my shoes (the car was following me closely enough that they couldn&#39;t see what kind of shoes I had) while I was actually taking off my flip-flops and tucking my iPod into my pocket. I grabbed my shoes, stood up, and sprinted back at the car. If there had been anyone in the passenger seat and they had opened their door, I would&#39;ve been on my ass. Thankfully, there wasn&#39;t. I sprinted back to my cabin as fast as I could, flew in the door, started to slam it but stopped it at the last second so I wouldn&#39;t wake up my grandpa, locked the door, and shut all the blinds and curtains. I didn&#39;t sleep for the rest of that night and every time a gust of wind blew the trees around, it scared the shit out of me and I started hyperventilating almost every time.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t even notice how much my feet hurt from sprinting barefoot on gravel until I took a shower the next morning.</p>

<p>Edit: I left the cabin at around 2:45am and was back inside by 3:15am. My grandpa still doesn&#39;t even know I left the cabin that night.</p>

<p>TL;DR: I was followed at ~3am when I was staying at a cabin in SD with my grandpa.</p>

<p>One was about a year ago. I was driving out to my cousins house, I had been staying with her and her husband for a couple weeks. I stopped by to feed my cat on the way before taking the main highway to her house. I live in a small tourist town in Southern New Mexico, it was a 45 minute drive to her house and the road was usually empty during the late hours of the night. As I was pulling off the road from my house back to the main highway, it looked like there was a man with a flashlight walking down the side of the road. There was only one street lamp and it was on the hill behind my car, so I couldn&#39;t really see him. He was pretty far from my car so I was sure I wouldn&#39;t get too close to him, and he was walking the opposite direction that I was going. After about a minute or two of driving, I looked at my passenger mirror and saw what looked like someone with a flashlight running towards the car and they were gaining fast. On instinct of fear, I sped up, occasionally looking back to see if they were still chasing me. When my attention had turned back to the road, it looked like a large black object was running across the street. I slammed on my brakes, skidding and nearly flipping my car. I still don&#39;t know what ran across the street or what was chasing me. What made this so scary, is that the speed limit is 60 mph (Roughly 96 kmh) on that highway.</p>

<p>The second scariest thing that ever happened was a few years ago at a friends house. She lived in the wooded area of our town, close to the base of a mountain. We had stayed up pretty late watching movies, ending with a horror movie, as you do. After going to bed, I remember thinking I heard something  outside before we fell asleep. I had a dream that I was walking through the woods, and that something was standing next to me. The woods seemed to go on forever and there was&#39;t much noise, which was strange. All of a sudden I started to run and I could hear something shouting my name behind me. I tripped in my dream and woke up. My friend was crouched over me shaking me awake and asking me if I was okay. I didn&#39;t understand what she was talking about until I realized we were outside at the edge of the forest near her house. I had walked downstairs and outside still asleep. She apologized for tackling me to the ground, but she didn&#39;t know what else to do since I wasn&#39;t waking up. Needless to say we didn&#39;t go back to sleep that night.</p>

I have never been to London, so my dream version of this place must’ve been made up of what I’ve seen from movies and TV shows.  It was a mix of time periods.  Most people were riding on carriages pulled by horses, but occasionally there would be a modern 2000’s car.  Some people wore old fashioned dresses and suites, while others would be wearing jeans, hoodies, shorts and so on.  </p>

<p>It was at the moment a relatively peaceful dream.  I remember sitting next to my mother while we were riding on a carriage.  We took pictures, laughed, talked, we were enjoying ourselves.</p>

<p>The carriage stopped in front of what looked like an apartment building built into a long strip of other apartments.  Me and my family stepped off the carriage and entered the apartment.  I was delighted to find a small art shop and/or museum inside.  Canvas’ and frames of paintings covered the walls with a variety of portraits, landscapes, ect. </p>

<p>There was a small picture frame on the wall with text on it.  This caught my eye because unlike everything else, there was no painting on this frame, just words.  I don’t remember what the message on the frame was.  All I remember was that it made me go from enjoying my time in London, to feeling afraid for my life.</p>

<p>I was suddenly hit with a wave of dread while reading the text.  The message on the frame was for me.  Weather it was a warning or a threat, I don’t remember.</p>

<p>In a split second I was pulled away from my dream, I was awake now.  Right before I opened my eyes, I could hear my bedroom door rapidly swing open and then SLAM shut.  I tried to get up, but I couldn’t.</p>

<p>Immediately after the slam, I could hear something crawling on the floor.  It was coming towards me.  I struggled inside my mind and body to get myself to move.  But all I could do was lay on my back.  My pillow had my head tilted upward a little.  So I could see, my bedroom door and the end of my bed.</p>

<p>As quickly as the crawling started, it had ended.  But to my horror, it had stopped at the left side of the bed.  That was the side I was laying on.  It was right next to me and out of my field of vision.</p>

<p>Silence filled the room.  I tried to turn my head to see what was next to me, but couldn’t.  I couldn’t move and there was no chance of it, so I at least wanted to know what was in my bedroom with me.  I tried to call out; “Who’s there?”  But all I could do was mumble and repeat “who” over and over.</p>

<p>I could feel a presence move closer to my left ear.  My mumbles got a reply:</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>Its voice was the deepest I had ever heard and it echoed as if it were deep in a cavern.  I couldn’t tell if it was taunting me or if it genuinely wanted to know what I was trying to say. </p>

<p>I was not actually expecting a reply.  This horrified me and confirmed to me (at the moment) that there was actually something next to me.  I struggled to move however way I could.  I tried wiggling my toes and fingers.  Both proved to be extremely difficult.  I tried breathing in deeply, but it was impossible.  I tried to speak again, for no reason that I can remember I chose to copy the things reply.  I repeated “huh?” Over and over.</p>

<p>I could feel it come even closer to my ear and it spoke again with malice:</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>By its tone, I could tell that it was indeed taunting me.  This thing was amused by my fear.  I realized that I was now copying what it just said.  I could hear it breathing next to my ear.</p>

<p>I could tell that nothing I was doing was working out for me and it wasn’t going to.  I eventually stopped speaking, it was a struggle to do so because of the overwhelming fear.</p>

<p>I wanted this to end so badly.  I figured that if I couldn’t move or speak, then I could use my inner monologue, my thoughts.  I didn’t know what to think of and I was so desperate, so I prayed.  I grew up in a very religious household, so prayer was familiar to me.  I never whole-heartedly believed in the religion my family practiced and prayer never did anything for me, but I tried anyway. </p>

<p>I could feel the thing crawl to the end of my bed, then underneath my bed, then to the right side of it, then underneath again.  It wouldn’t stop crawling.  It screamed as I prayed.  I would estimate that this went on for two minutes or longer.</p>

<p>Then the screaming stopped.  I had control over my body again.  I immediately sat up and took a deep breath. </p>

<p>I was panicking in my head, wondering what the hell just happened.  Wondering if the thing was still in the room with me.  I sat there for about ten minutes and then it finally hit me.  I had just experienced another sleep paralysis episode. </p>

<p>Eventually I calmed myself down.  So I laid back and fell back asleep.</p>
