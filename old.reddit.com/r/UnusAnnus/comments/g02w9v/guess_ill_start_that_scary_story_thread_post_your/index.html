<p>When I was a child me and my mother lived in an apartment in the highest floor. Every night I woke up to weird flying green things. I could never identify them, but they kept coming. I think they might have been ghost trying to warn me, since only a few months after we moved into the apartment I woke up to the flying things again, but this time I was smelling smoke. I went to my mom and told her. She agreed it was smoke. We evacuated the entire house. Turns out it was burning a few floor below. If I wouldn&#39;t have woken up this could have been it. I never saw the ghosts again.</p>

I was probably about ten and at the time we lived above a post office which my mum and dad owned. It was at that time where people were starting to blow up cash machines to get the money and luckily for me, my bedroom was right above the atm.
So I was sleeping when I hear this banging sound and hushed voices before all of a sudden the alarm is going off and my mum bursts into my room saying &#39;get into your brothers room and lock your door right now!&#39;. I was shaking and hudled on my brothers bed we waited for the police siren. We didn&#39;t leave his room for hours because we were so scared. Turns out they were armed too. It took me weeks to sleep after that.</p>

 I remember when I was really little I had bad epilepsy and was prescribed a medicine to deal with it. Unfortunately the side effect of the medicine was vivid night terrors. I would wake up in the middle of the night screaming. This happened several times. I don&#39;t remember any of the things I thought I saw except one. I woke up in the middle of the night and my door was open with the hallway light on as well. Standing in my doorway was this really big black wolf standing upright with scraggly fur and it was uncomfortably thin everywhere. Like body wise and snout wise. It just stared at me until it walked away and I&#39;ve never seen anything like it to this day.<strong>Show less</strong></p>

<p>I was in bed late at night scrolling through my phone and listening to music. I had one earbud in so I could hear slight noise, but not a lot of it. It was around 11 PM when I heard a strange noise in the hall, I paused my music to listen. It sounded like someone was walking around the hallway outside my room (for context, my parents room is right across from mine and my brothers is next to mine as well.) It went on for about a minute then stopped. I was a bit freaked out but went back to my phone regardless. a few minutes later, it happened again, now it was much louder. It sounded like the footsteps were headed to my bedroom door, but they stopped once they actually made it to the door. I was thoroughly freaked out at this point and started frantically texting a friend on discord and pulling the covers over my head (Not what I should have done, but I was 14.)   </p>

<p>This continued for about 20 minutes, the footsteps would go to my rooms door, my brothers, my parents, and then circle for a bit. All the while I was too scared to get up and open the door in case a robber or something was in my house. After one last round of footsteps...they just went away. It sounded like they just walked away. Once I knew the coast was clear, I got the courage to stand up and head to the door and open it. Nothing was there. My parents door was closed, my brothers door was closed too, and my animals were all downstairs sleeping. I even went downstairs to check if the door was unlocked or the backdoor was broken into, nothing.   </p>

<p>Safe to say I had trouble getting some sleep last night. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>TL;DR I thought I heard someone walking in my house, turned out to be nothing.</p>

She’s very religious, attends church and all that stuff. I call her Nana. I was three, and everything was going normal. I had been playing in the backyard, petting the cat, everything. It was great. I always enjoyed spending time there. That was soon about to change. I had no idea what was going to happen that night.</p>

<p>I had finished my nightly routine there. Two Oreos and milk. I brushed my teeth and took a bath, changing into a night gown. Every night my Nana would read me a book. We were laying in bed in the guest room as she finished reading. I didn’t know this at the time, but she pretend to sleep with me until I fell asleep. Then, she would go down the hallway into her bedroom with her husband. I woke up that night at around 1:20AM, thirsty for a glass of water. I was confused as to why Nana wasn’t there with me. I figured she had gone to the bathroom.</p>

<p>I hopped off of the bed. That night felt strange. There was a sinister, dark presence in the house. It was extremely cold, when it was usually very warm and comforting. The closer I got to exiting the room, the worse the presence got. I slowly opened the door, standing on my toes. I walked out into the hallway, about to turn right to go into the kitchen. Then I saw him. Or rather… It.</p>

<p>I saw something from my peripheral vision. A tall, skinny figure. I was frozen in place, it felt like my entire body had been chilled to the core. I can’t describe how horrifying it was. The creature had the upper torso of a starved man, but the skin was gray. It had two, red glowing eyes that stared into me. It’s lower body wasn’t normal. It had the legs of a goat. Once I realized this, I looked for horns. And, there they were. Massive antlers on its head. It’s arms were unnaturally long. The hands were large, and boney. The nails looked more like sharp bones extruding from its fingertips.</p>

<p>I tried to scream, but couldn’t. I was stuck. It slowly raised its arm, and began to speak. Though, the language wasn’t human. It’s voice was raspy, quiet, and sounded like a dying animal. Though it wasn’t speaking English, I understood it. It was talking about how nobody would love me, how I would have a horrible future, and live a life of misfortune and death. The last thing it said scared me the most. It said I would never escape it. It said it would always follow me. No matter how hard I tried to rid myself from it. I ran away faster than I thought any human could. I hid next to the pantry, sliding down the wall. I covered my mouth with both hands to muffle my wailing. I heard the tapping of hooves, and the scratching of nails on a wall start to near me. It was coming closer and closer to where I was, laughing. It was amused by my fear and horror.</p>

<p>Soon, before it reached me, my Nana came out. She ran over to me, frantically asking what had happened. I tried to explain through gasps of air and choking on tears, but she didn’t believe me. She said it was my imagination. I didn’t look down the hallway that night. Once Nana said that she would call my parents, I was sitting down on the couch. A cartoon was playing while I drank water to calm myself down. I wasn’t crying anymore, but I was still scared shitless. My mom knocked on the door about 15 minutes after Nana said that she would be on her way. As soon as she opened it, the creature whispered one last thing to me. “I’ll be back soon, little one. You won’t escape.”</p>

<p>My mom drove me home, obviously shaken by the entire event. It was rare to see her like that. We stayed up together, not getting a wink of sleep. Ever since that, I haven’t stopped seeing monsters and demons. The creature was right. It always, always had eyes on me.</p>

<p>Have fun sleeping tonight! :)</p>

I dont really believe this, I dont believe in paranormal shit and i dont think you could remember that at 3. I get it if it really happpened you could remember the ghost and stuff. But how you remember every detail. I dont get it. If I actually would experience paranormal firsthand id believe it more. You dont have to reply, just stating my opinion. I&#39;m not trying to sound like an asshole, i hope you get that. Not trying to shit on the story, either, real or not, its still creepy asf.</p>

My monster is eerily similar to yours, except that his skin was like black leather and I didn&#39;t see his feet. His most prominent features were his long bony hands, malnourished body, and his red eyes on a face filled with teeth. His head almost resembled a wolf more than a goat to me because of how large his mouth and teeth were. And he did not talk to me, but I felt that he was there to kill me. It was as though he was screaming KILL into my mind as he tried to grab me. And I have never SEEN a monster before this. He was actually physically there but it was as though there were two layers of reality, like he existed on the second layer as if someone had laid down a piece of transfer paper over my world which allowed him to interact with objects and break them. But if I focused hard enough on actual reality, I would see that nothing was broken... most terrifying moment of my life.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to post my story in more detail but I had to comment because yours struck me by the similarities of the monster/demon that you described. Maybe he haunts us both, I have named him Remor, after the monster from Fran Bow. I think it suits him.</p>

For context,  my section has to use double doors at the front of the school to get our large equipment out.  There&#39;s often a vertical bar between those doors that we have to remove using a key. One day, we couldn&#39;t get the bar off for some reason, and we had to take an alternate route  to bring the instruments back in the school. This route happened to be through the pitch black basket ball court with the only faint source of light being the open door leading to outside.  I was walking in the dark court on my way to get more stuff from the field, when I hear a  monstrous shriek and heavy footsteps on my right, as if  something was going to rip my throat out.  I couldn&#39;t see anything, and all I knew is the general area of where the sound came from. Therefore, the sound in combination with the fact that I have no idea where the the source of it was specifically was more than enough to make my yell out loud. I wouldn&#39;t be lying if I said I nearly pissed my pants. 5 seconds later, and I find out it was a smart ass freshman who thought it would be funny to scare the next person into next week. I chuckled it off, legitimately trying to be a good sport. But I was more afraid for my life than anything else for the rest of the day</p>

(I made a main post before seeing this thread so here it is again) I have two stories that come to mind having been the most terrifying events of life. The first one is as follows:</p>

<p>I was living In the desert of California, not far from Barstow, my parents stayed out late for a date night leaving my brother and I home alone at the ages of 13 and 11, respectively. As per-usual, my brother and I were given a small list of chores for the day, my most relevant chore being to mop our hardwood floors. It’s important to mention that our house was small and every room besides bedrooms and the living room were all hard wood floors. A few hours after I finished my list of chores my parents and god mother came home to what they described as a terrifying scene. Our house had a hallway that held a linen closet at the start, directly across from my parents bedroom door, my bedroom was in the middle of said hallway and my brothers, at the end. The linen closet was packed with shelves and with no room for even someone as small as I was, to fit in, yet at odd hours of the night, and most mornings, my three dogs would wake everyone with there growling at that closet. On the night in question, my parents rounded the corner of the hallway and saw a pair of dried up, muddy, boney footprints leading from that closet directly into my bedroom. They compared the feet size to everyone’s in the house but found ours were all too big to match the foot prints. From that night, my dogs growling at the closet stopped and they started growling at my bedroom door. When playing in my room I’d always hear a faint echo of whatever I did said back to me In a little boys voice. One day I got mad because nobody believed me so I screamed at the voice to stop and my hand crafted, iron, jewelry box flew off the vanity and broke. My dad eventually believed my stories when, In the empty house, he heard a knock at his door, a little boy ask for him to come play saying the words “daddy, daddy, come play, will you come play?” and thinking it was my brother or I having come home, my dad opens his door only to find those same footprints leading from his room back to mine and my bedroom door slam shut. We moved shortly after, but we still reference that little boy, having named him Jessie. </p>

<p>The second story is much shorter. It happened three years ago. I was home alone while my parents were out, I was simply watching a movie around 9-10 o’clock at night when I got a phone call from my parents. They said they were glancing at our security cameras when they saw a man inside the house with me, he was in the basement, I on the main floor. My mom told me to make my way to their bedroom where we have deadbolt locks and other security measures. The police arrived almost the same time as my parents and they removed the man who had carved out a pocket in our couch so he could hide within the couch until, what the cops believed would be, the ideal time to follow through with whatever his plans were. Now this isn’t as intense as some other issues I’ve experienced, but the terrifying aspect was not the actual man when I look back, but instead my moms words “don’t scream, don’t panic, but there’s a man in the house, he’s in the house with you”.</p>

My cousin and I shared the top bunk in my grandma&#39;s room. It was late at night, and being the kids we were, we stayed up to watch tv and be on our phones. Everything was going normal that is until it turned 12. Laying in bed with the covers on, my cousin and I were talking to each other about random things, I don&#39;t remember exactly what we were talking about but what I do remember was that we heard a bang and a loud scream coming from our backyard. We both look at each other in shock before pulling the covers up over our heads and trying to get some sleep, but lord knows we couldn&#39;t after that. We stayed up some more looking at the window scared, it had a curtain on so we couldn&#39;t see the outside it made us wonder if we were lucky or curse to be in fear of what was on the other side. I don&#39;t remember when we fell asleep but we did, and that morning we talked to each other trying to figure out what had happened. I knew it wasn&#39;t an animal, we live in an urban area the only animals here were birds, bugs, and mice. In fact, to us, it sounded human. We looked on the news, newspapers, online, but we found nothing. I&#39;m not sure what happened that night, and I don&#39;t think I want to, but I can&#39;t help but wonder what would have happened if our window didn&#39;t have a curtain? Would we have seen what happened, would it have revealed something paranormal? My cousin didn&#39;t have an explanation and neither did I. I believed it was something paranormal, I still do.</p>

My sister and I went to the Alamo in Texas because I am a huge history buff. We were overcome by the heaviness and my sister placed her hand on the wall. She whispered for me to do the same. The moment I made contact, it felt as though I had been burnt. I recoiled because of the pain and realized that my finger tips were red. My sister’s hand was fine. The next few hours we explored the rest of San Antonio while I cradled my hand until the burns disappeared.</p>

When he came home she told him everything that she saw a dark figure at the door and it was walking near her. She hardly got any sleep that night. It&#39;s 2019 she moved out and me and my brother have her room now. One day it was about 9ish at night and everybody was in the living room but I was in the room that night was pitch dark and all I had was my tablet on just watching some videos of Markiplier or game theory. I looked up and I saw the dark figure in my closet and I was scared to death I didn&#39;t say anything I just played it off like oh okay my jacket is right there but inside I was frightened I knew there was a figure in my closet so I got my tablet turn up the brightness so all of the room can be bright and I&#39;ll be able to see at least something and when the room light was on I got up I looked in the closet and it was gone.I went to the living room to tell everybody that was there that I saw a black figure but no they didn&#39;t believe me but my sister did because she knew she saw that exact figure when she slept in that room.</p>

(I was about 13) My mom and I used to run a hotel when we lived in Wyoming , and we had a house that connected to it where we stayed. One night, I woke up cause I thought I heard my mom coming to check on me and when I looked up to my door, there was a large dark figure that I had to squint to see cause I didn&#39;t have my glasses on. I put on my classes and saw that it was a 6-7 foot deer looking creature that was standing on it&#39;s back legs and had blood dripping from it&#39;s fur. I was so shocked that I couldn&#39;t take my eyes off of it and continued to stare until it eventually stared back and started walking towards me. Out of fear I put my head under my blankets and shut my eyes. The moment they were closed I heard screaming and opened them to see I screaming woman in my bed. I jumped up and turned on my light to see that there was nothing there.... I didn&#39;t sleep for the rest of the night and instantly looked up what I saw. It was a wendigo (not the kind from until dawn, the kind from legends) ( look it up if you want). And every night after that that I slept in that room, I had everything locked and my lamp right next to me so I could easily reach it.
You may not read this or put it in a video, but I just thought it was creepy enough to share</p>

She, four of her sisters and her brother were home alone as her parents had gone for a meal. They had a neighbour who had drowned very recently (his body had been found maybe two or three days prior to this after being missing for three days) and he was really nice and sweet so they wanted to talk to him through a ouija board. They had set up the candles and turned off all the lights, whilst they were trying to use the board the candles were blown by a sudden gust of wind, then they heard crashing from the kitchen. After a while they forced the brother to check it out and he found that all the plates and such had been smashed and the cupboard doors were open. At this point they all huddled together on a bed to wait for the parents to get home, once they did they shouted to them as to what the hell had happened and they went into the kitchen to find all the shattered plates and bowls whole, but stacked up orderly on the kitchen floor.  </p>

<p>Another time she was walking to school on a path through some woods and suddenly these three men in red (I think) robes were running after her with axes. She managed to outrun them, but when she got home she asked her parents about it and it was a cult that was beheading little girls for sacrifices ( this all happened in Poland about 15+ years ago)</p>

I was pretty excited since this was my first playdate. My mom picked up my friend and we headed to the bank so that my mom could get some extra cash. She told us to stay in the car and lock the doors, since the bank was in near a bad neighborhood. We said okay and my mom left. </p>

<p>Me and my friend started talking, and a few minutes after my mom left, my friend tells me to lock the door. I said &quot;Why should I lock the doors anyway? It&#39;s not like anyone is going to take us away.&quot; My friend was still persistent in locking the doors, so I locked it.</p>

<p>Not even a minute goes by, and we hear a sudden and loud knocking from a door. My friend and I jump, and we turn to look at the driver&#39;s window to see who was knocking so loud. A man, in his late forties to late fifties greeted our view. We we terrified, to say the least. The man kept on knocking and banging on the car, until he left. The strange thing is that, even though the windows all had a dark tint,  that made looking into the car almost near impossible, he was still able to make direct eye contact with me. A few seconds later my mom came by and we drove off. Me and my friend never told my mom what happened.</p>

<p>Five years later, and to this day, I still wonder if what would happen if I never complied to my friend&#39;s wish of locking the doors.</p>

<p>So, I have chronic migraines, and I&#39;m used to always having my head hurt. Sometimes, the pain from my migraines does affect my vision as well, making the edges of my sight all fuzzy and black if I do things too quickly. So, one day, about a month ago, my head was hurting extremely bad, worse than normal. I was just chilling in my dorm room, and I&#39;d gone to get up to get some water or something, I can&#39;t quite remember. When I stood up, my vision blacked out and it took me a moment to regain my balance. But, as my vision started to come back, there was a massive black shadowy figure in front of me. I&#39;ve seen them before, in fact I see them often, but they never came near me, much less grabbed me like this one did. It grabbed my shoulders, and excruciating pain shot down my back, and my entire body spazzed out. I couldn&#39;t move, couldn&#39;t breathe, and in seconds I was on the floor. It felt so real... but my roommate didn&#39;t see anything, and she was sitting at the desk next to me. She said one second I was getting up from bed, and the next thing she heard was me hitting the floor and crying out in pain. To this day I still do not know what those shadows are that I see, or why that one came up to me.</p>

His parents both died in the house prior to us moving in. His father passed on the couch in the living room and his mother passed in their bedroom. You could imagine already having that knowledge it made the house when you were alone very creepy. I did sense his parents around the house at times but it definitely felt like there was different energy in the house. Like a darker energy. One night me and my sister came back in the house from smoking in the backyard (you know what teenagers do). We were the only ones up this night. I went into our bedroom at the beginning of the hallway and she went into the bathroom that was at the end of it. I was getting ready to go on the computer when i started hearing what sounded like someone taking their nails and dragging it down the hallway wall leading up to my doorway. Out of the corner of my eye, i saw what looked like a black figure peeking for a second to look at me. My sister at the time was wearing all black so i thought it was her playing a joke on me. So i got up to sneak up to the door, and to jump out yelling “AHH” only to find out that she was not standing in the hallway. In fact she was still in the bathroom with the door shut. This freaked me out and i tried to figure out what that possibly could have been, when my sister comes racing down the hallway in a panic. She tells me, “I’m not trying to freak you out but, i was hearing scratching at the bathroom door. Like someone was clawing at it.” I told her what i experienced and told her when i jumped out she finished my sentence and goes “i was still in the bathroom.” I said “yup” and we shut our bedroom door as fast as we could and didn’t come out the whole night.</p>

To get there, we took a coach to central London. Along the way, we passed a little church with a graveyard attached. The graveyard was surrounded by this big iron gate, with a big lock, proper movie type look. We get stuck in traffic right beside this church, and my window seat stops right beside the graveyard. I&#39;m sat there, staring out the window, when I suddenly see people inside, interacting with the tombstones. Walking around, standing in front of them, touching them etc. I couldnt make out details, they looked like shadows, like they were made of mist. Thing is...the graveyard was locked, no one was inside. As I stared at the figures, I realised I couldnt move. I was paralysed. A few of them turned to face me and waved. I tried to scream, and a voice in my head was screaming &quot;look away, look away now&quot; I had this awful feeling in my chest...this huge wave of sadness. I couldnt even hear properly, all sounds were muffled  and the light faded away, like I was underwater. All that existed was the graveyard and the figures. Next thing I know, theres a sharp pain in my arm, and I can move again. I turn to her, annoyed, and she stares that she pinched my arm as she had been calling me for the past five minutes, but I was unresponsive. She had tapped my shoulder and still nothing. She said I was wheezing, staring out the window. She called the teacher over with my inhaler, as she thought I was having an asthma attack, but I felt fine. I apologized and said I had zoned out, but I still had that lingering feeling. I looked back at the graveyard, but it was empty. Just an ordinary graveyard. I dont know whether I had just had a panic attack, or if I saw...something, but i still feel that same feeling of sadness when I drive past graveyards. Strangly, sometimes I feel like I can&#39;t look at them, other times I feel almost...drawn to them. Like someone is calling me, like this pull at the back of my mind. So yeah. That&#39;s my.odd little story.
As for the experience i have almost every night ||i hear people talk to me. I&#39;m certain it isnt my thoughts, as the things i hear are not said in my voice. I&#39;ve heard what sounds like a group of kids chanting &quot;ashes to ashes, dust to dust&quot;, as well as repeating my name over and over again, I&#39;ve heard a woman saying &quot;goodnight, goodbye, hello &quot;and humming, and I&#39;ve heard a man saying &quot;she&#39;s asleep&quot; and &quot;I&#39;ll keep watch&quot; no clue how to explain that. Its definitely not my neighbor&#39;s either, the voices dont match.
I also tend to have extremely vivid nightmares/waking nightmares. Like the kind where I can still feel any pain I sustained in the dream. 
Sorry for the long read!</p>

She had this old crawl space/storage room in her basement that but had enough room for us to sit on the floor, in the dark, surrounded by shelves filled with stuff.  So one day, sitting on cushions with candles lit and scattered around the stuffed shelves (I&#39;m surprised we never burnt the house down) - she decided to bring out an ouija board. I was a skeptic about ghosts and stuff so wasn&#39;t really thinking about it and I can&#39;t even remember who we were trying to contact but I do remember getting chills and just this sense of fear. She blew out a few candles trying to be dramatic, but nothing happened. The real fright started when I got home that night, (some backstory - my bedroom was in the basement which just left me with a small little window that looked out into the backyard that was at ground level due to the awkward placing I didn&#39;t have any drapes covering it. My bed was one of those half bunkbeds at like waist height so I was closer to the window than a regular bed)</p>

<p>So that night, I was woken up by something knocking on the window. I was pretty used to hearing raccoons break into the garbage up there and sometimes making noise in the garage so I ignored it until it stopped suddenly. All I remember is feeling fear and ice seemed to rush through my veins. I looked but it was pitch black outside the window, I couldn&#39;t see anything,  then I blinked and I swear there were two glowing white eyes pressed up against the glass. looking right at me. Something wanted to get in.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know how I got back to sleep but since then I was terrified about that window at night, always thinking something was watching me as I slept. eventually I got a poster up and covered it that way but didn&#39;t really help the feeling until we moved out of that house. Also I couldn&#39;t go back into my friend&#39;s crawlspace. It was like something originated there in the dark even being in her basement sometimes still have me that feeling. As far as I know she never experienced anything like I did. </p>

<p>Never believed in ghosts but now firmly believe in a just don&#39;t mess with it philosophy.</p>

<p>TD;LR my friend and I messed with an Oujia board, saw eyes in the dark and the rest of my childhood felt something watching me as I slept.</p>

Here&#39;s the first one
So this happened to me like last year. I was brushing my teeth in the hallway bathroom (our apartment has three bathrooms, one is in my parents room, the second is in me and my brother&#39;s room and the third is in the hallway). I use the hallway bathroom because there isn&#39;t enough space in the one with me and my brother&#39;s room. So anyway I was brushing my teeth when I looked in the mirror and saw some black thing like a boy go running behind me and into our bedroom. I thought it was just my brother but for some reason I kept looking at the mirror. No one came back. After brushing my teeth I looked into our bedroom and saw the bathroom door was closed meaning someone was inside because the lock to that bathroom was broken and you had to hold it to keep it closed. Seeing that it was closed I walked back into the lounge. My brother was sitting there in the lounge. So were my parents. I still haven&#39;t understood what or who I saw running across the hallway into me and my brother&#39;s bedroom</p>

This happened to me around two years ago. I woke up in the middle of the night with an absolutely dry throat. I felt as if though I was dying of thirst. It was so bad that I couldn&#39;t even get up to drink a glass of water. I lay there on my bed for quite a while just staring at the light falling on one of the cupboards from the hall way.
I had closed my eyes for a little while and when I opened them I saw a silhouette of a man in the doorway. His shadow was formed on the cupboard due to the hallway light. I thought it was my father so I said as loud as I could &quot;water&quot;. My parents would often check on me and my brother during the night and I would sometimes when I was thirsty just say water and they would bring it. The shadow didnt move. I thought perhaps my father didnt hear me so I tried again a little louder than before &quot;water&quot;. I was pretty sure that he had heard me. I said water around 3-4 times and when I had finally given up the shadow moved in the direction of the kitchen. I didnt notice at first but that shadow had a different posture than my father&#39;s. My father would walk with a completely straight back while this shadow was walking with his back a little bent. I either didnt notice at the time or didnt care. I just wanted some water. I lay there for what seemed like forever but noone came back. I dont know how I fell asleep but when I woke up the first thing I did was drink alot of water and then ask my father why he didn&#39;t get me a glass of water. My father looked at me confused and said that he hadn&#39;t got up the entire night. He said he had never come near my bedroom as he had been sleeping all night. This had really creeped me out and for the rest of the winter i made sure to drink water before going to bed so that I didnt wake up in the middle of the night and see that strange man again.</p>

So this is a short thing that happened with me. Around 2-3 years ago one night I was laying in my bed while my brother was sleeping (we both share a bedroom). The air conditoner was on and I was about to go to sleep. We have a large pedestal fan in our bedroom. My eyes were about to close when the fan turned on. I thought that maybe it was one of my parents who had turned it on so I turned on to my stomach so that I could see who had turned it on. I was looking at the switches when all of a sudden the fan turned off. My eyesight isn&#39;t good and I cant see shit without my glasses. Because of that I couldn&#39;t tell whether the switch was flipped or not.
Keep in mind that this pedestal fan had no more functions than on/off and three speed settings. No timer, alarm, automatic on/off whatsoever. I honestly dont know how I went to sleep that night</p>

My grandmother had brought back some sort of special dirt from Japan in a pouch (I think it was from someplace spiritual? But I can&#39;t remember where). While the dirt was in our house, my aunt would have seizures and start babbling during them. Eventually my grandma decided it must be the dirt and arranged for it to be sent all the way back to Japan where it came from. After the dirt was gone the seizures stopped. My aunt&#39;s son and grandson claim they&#39;ve had lots of ghost encounters too, such as seeing a little girl in their backseat. Maybe it runs in the family.

<p>When my mom was young she moved from her hometown to go live with my aunt 7 hours away. My aunt used to live in a house that many family members believed it was haunted. They would see shadows, her noises, people talking in the rooms when they were empty. My mom said that the most haunted room was my cousins that would occasionally sleepwalk. Back home my mom had a guy best friend and they were really close. One night my mom was asleep and she started to have a nightmare about someone chasing her and trying to kill her. They had caught her and started to stab her. Frighten my mom woke up and she saw my cousin right next to her looking at my mom. My cousin was sleepwalking again and had stood next to my mom. My mom got up and took her back to her room. However, back home my mom’s friend had just gotten home from clubbing and was then called to go “hang out” again. That same night my mom had that nightmare her friend was brutally murdered back home (he was stabbed and more). My mom did not know what had happened to her friend till days later after she received the newspaper from back home through the mail with her friends murder in the headline. My mom still wonders if it was a coincidence that she had that nightmare the same night her friend was murder or was it the entity using my cousin trying to tell her that her friend was being murdered.</p>

<p>Growing up I used to have dreams I would Deja Vu&#39;s since whenever they happened, it was bound to happen in real life. 
Once I had a flash deja vu dream that I was slumped on the staircase of my old house staring at the kitchen floor. But as soon as I woke up I dismissed it, not knowing what it was. 
At the time my dad was fighting a rare form of lung cancer and I had the upmost belief that he would be ok since it was still early stages. 
Until December 4th hit. 
I remember that day all to well unfortunately, as soon as the news hit I couldn&#39;t even cry. I just remember walking around like I got punched in the gut until I slumped down by the staircase staring at the kitchen. </p>

<p>The Deja Vu dreams don&#39;t come as much as they used to but I assume it&#39;s only when important events are coming up is when they return. So for now, I wait.</p>

<p>So a few years ago I would have a recurring dream where a pale white man in a robe would enter my room, he would walk around and just stare at me. Every time he entered he would just pick up things in my room and then leave. One time in one of the dreams he exited my room through the window next to my bed, I woke up standing in front of the window staring through it. By far the scariest thing to happen is when I was seeing through his eyes(I am pretty sure it was him). I was just looking over my sleeping body, then I heard someone whisper a name. I woke up terrified but I searched up the name(this was a while ago I Don&#39;t remember the name) and I was shocked at what I saw, after scrolling through some random images I found what looked like an old black and white photo of a robe and pale white hands, It has been a long time since I have had one of these dreams and I hope I never experience one again.</p>

My dad died two years ago, so me and my mom live alone on an old ranch. There&#39;s an old gravel road leading to our house with barbed wire fencing on each side. One night when we were driving home in the dark, we turned a corner and saw the skin of a weird dog like creature shredded and strung on the fence, like someone had hung it there. We went home and called our landlord, whi said she&#39;d check in the morning. When she woke up, it had disappeared except for some dried blood on tge fence. We still don&#39;t know what really happened.</p>

One time me and two of my friends were leaving a Chick-fil-A. This weird 40 year old dude walked up to us and said that his car was broken down and he needed help. He said he was missing a part from his car (he gave us a specific name for the part I don’t remember the name of) He seemed very intent that we come to his car and help him out. The oldest of the group told me and my other friend to get in the car and wait. She kept questioning him on what the exact thing he needed for his car and said he just needed us to come to his car to see. The whole situation just seemed shady and not okay. Eventually, another dude came over and said what’s going on and she told him and told us to get going. The man and this dude then started to argue over the situation. We left quickly without seeing the result but I’m pretty sure something bad would’ve happened if that dude had not interfered.</p>

<p>I was 6 and sleeping in a small bed in my room,it peaceful. I had a dream that I was in a light gray hallway with one side getting brighter and one side getting darker. First I walked to the lighter way and saw strange figures standing and waiting, they where calling my name too, I got scared and turned around and started walking towards the darker way. With each step it got hotter and hotter but in the dream I felt a large hand touch my back. The hand felt to be about a foot and a half wide, once it made contact with my back I woke up. I couldn&#39;t move for a minute or so. And then I went back to sleep.</p>

<p>TL: DR Ive told this story to others and they all respond the same, that I died in my sleep, was going to hell, something greater that was in contact with me and that i came back to life.</p>

<p><strong>I know, weird.</strong></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Yall are gonna have to bear with me because I&#39;m not really used to doing this but anyway.</p>

<p>So these stories happened when I was like 12-13, I&#39;ll start with the weird but shorter story. For context both of these stories happened when I was on the way back from my dance classes which are about a half an hour drive away from where I live.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Story 1:</p>

<p>So it was probably about 9:30(pm) and I was exhausted. My dad was driving me home through kind of a back roads area? (Idk) We were driving by a small forest and out of nowhere a extremely tall dark figure ran across the road right in front of the car. I asked my dad &quot;Did you see that?&quot; and he looked at me and said &quot;What???&quot; as it turns out I was just hallucinating. That was a pretty scary experience for me but now that I know I was just hallucinating it isn&#39;t as scary.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Story 2:</p>

<p>This story happened yet again at around 9:30ish when we were driving home. We were back around those woods again and I saw something in the road, I figured I was just hallucinating again until my dad slammed on the brakes. We ended running over what ever it was so my dad stopped the car to get out and investigate. Turns out we just ended up running over a poor porcupine (sorry mister/miss porcupine) Don&#39;t worry though, this story has a good end. After a few minutes of my dad poking the porcupine with his shoe(?) it finally got up and walked back into the woods unharmed. My dad had to wear a different pair of shoes for a while because there were quills in his shoes for days after.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I woke up in the middle of the night. Now to set the scene, my mother was asleep in the her bedroom on the other side of the house and no one else was in the house with us. I don’t know what time it was but I knew it was late in the morning. Anyways, I woke up to see my bedroom door had opened and I heard faint giggles coming from the hallway. Not leaving my bed, I called out and said “who’s there?”... the giggles continued and a creepy woman like voice called out to me and said “hello Sherie (my name)... I’m going to get you.. just you wait..” followed by a big laugh... 
Now it was definitely not my mother as she took sleeping tablets which knock her out cold...</p>

<p>Also when I was around 12-13, we had moved house. I had another strange occurrence. I woke up and noticed I could move my body but only my eyes, so I was experiencing sleep paralysis. I noticed my tv screen was blue even though it was turned off at the wall. All of a sudden I hear the familiar laugh I heard when I was 4-5. Then I heard the voice say “I’m coming for you”.</p>

<p>And then, when I was around 15, we moved house again and I experienced sleep paralysis again. And guess what happened? You guess it, the tv screen was blue and the same voice and giggles returned. This time, it really made threats. It said to me how it was going to capture me and torture me in ways no human can even imagine. And all I could do was close my eyes and try to ignore it. I somehow managed to fall asleep again...</p>

<p>So it turns out I have a maleficent spirit that is following me and wants to kill me 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

<p>I tend to have a lot of weird dreams, honestly I probably have more nightmares than dreams (mostly due to stress/unresolved problems), and even if they aren’t nightmares they are usually just very odd. Well, one night a few years back, I had a dream where I was in one of my classrooms. It was dark and quiet with only me and a classmate I barely knew (I’ll call her K.) The nightmare was horrible, K was tied to a chair while I watched myself mock and humiliate her. This went on for a little bit, with K pleading to be let go and wanting me to stop talking, until I grabbed her hand and broke one of her fingers (her pinkie finger on her left hand.) The dream ending as she cried out in pain.</p>

<p>Okay, that was weird and I really didn’t like that but oh well, it was over and I would never do that in real life. I barely even knew K, why was I dreaming of her? Anyways, I just tried to forget about it and got ready for school.</p>

<p>Time passed and I went to one of my classes (I believe English?) and it just so happened that K had the same class (I believe it was one of the only classes I had with her.) I saw her and I just...froze. K had a finger brace/cast on her left hand, on her pinkie. I couldn’t believe it, I walked up to her and immediately asked “K, how did you break your finger?” (Trying to be all cool about it but probably looking like I saw a ghost.)</p>

<p>K looked up at me and smiled, saying “Oh, I fell down the stairs yesterday. That’s why I wasn’t at school.”</p>

<p>I didn’t even know she wasn’t at school yesterday. Again, we barely talked, I barely acknowledged her existence so the situation shook me up a bit. I’ve had one or two more dreams that have “come true” so to speak but never to that degree. (Usually, having a dream that “X teacher was late to school and oh, X was late to school on that day.”)</p>

<p>Purely a coincidence (I don’t really believe in psychics and telling the future.) But still, that moment really had my mind racing and I would be lying if I said I didn’t act like a saint towards K whenever I could afterwards.</p>

My cousin and I were woken up by my grandma because the kitchen had everything rearranged. The placemats were standing up on the table, my little sister&#39;s shoes where hanging on the cabinets, cleaning supplies were placed in a circle and had a book in the middle, pictures were placed in front of all of the door ways, the cabinets under the sink were open, and no one heard anything all night. My grandma thought it was us but we feel asleep around 2(playing video games) so we both were knocked out. We decided that night we were gonna find out what it was so we got cameras and set them up in the kitchen. Everyone was in the living room and we could see orbs 8-10 of them flying around the room. I wanted answers so I peeked my head in the kitchen and saw a family of gray-faced sad people who were all bundled up close together. Behind them was a blacked-faced girl who stared right in my eyes and i felt sad, pain, and worthless when I went back to everyone I started to cry and I didn&#39;t know why. Every other day little things have happened in other rooms i felt someone lay in my bed with me and big spoon me but no one was there. After that day I started to heavily believe in ghosts.</p>

<p>My mom used to have an old car back when she was young and she was driving down the highway one night on her way home. Everything was fine until she started to see these 2 bright lights headed in her direction. Someone, probably drunk, was driving on the wrong side of the rode. She kept going but realized that the person wasn&#39;t going to actually move. She couldn&#39;t keep going otherwise the impact would have probably killed her, so she turned and ran through a guardrail into what she thought was just a simple wooded area. However, because it was dark, her eyes told her wrong and she ran off a hill. It wasn&#39;t anything horrible but it wasn&#39;t a tiny hill either. She rolled her car at least 15 times before she finally stopped in a little field. Her car was upside down and tilted on its side a little. Of course she was quite confused so she just sat there until she realized there was a thick white cloud coming from the car. Naturally my mom freaked out because she thought that the car was on fire and she was gonna die. It took her like 10 mins to unbuckle and break her way out of the car because the car was tilted more on the driver&#39;s side. She literally had to dig her way out of the car and when she got out she realized the car wasn&#39;t actually on fire and the cloud was just the cornstarch from the air bag (thank the GODS) and she managed to make her way back to the high way and flag down some roadside assistance. They never found the guy who caused it and my mom totaled her but she was safe and managed to make it home.</p>

We were playing on a vacant lot in front of this a abandoned house that our friend&#39;s family that left our town once have lived in. There is this spot that is slightly elevated that is covered by dense grass and some trees on the side, it has these ropes tied from one end to another used as a clothesline. Then one time when were running around trying to hide behind a tree, we ran through some blanket, me and my friend noticed a large black foot setted beneath the blanket just on the other side of us, or in front, anyway, it&#39;s not wearing any flipflops or anything, just plain really really big black foot and only one. So we tried to scare it off because we thought someone was messing with us, the  we push through the blanket and there was nothing. The foot was gone and we both ran towards our friends and asked if there was anyone with us that time.</p>

I just seem to attract scary things. Here’s one that really scared me.</p>

<p>I used to live in a two story house in Spanaway, WA. It was a really nice house that my dad could barely afford. And I went to really shitty schools. My math teacher called me Autistic brother a Monster right in front of me and the class. (Needless to say I ripped her a new one after hearing this because fuck you Mrs. Pitingoro)</p>

<p>The house had four bedrooms upstairs, one full bathroom upstairs and a half bath down stairs that was next to the wash room and garage.</p>

<p>I’m that house, I had an imaginary friend named Elizabeth. I really was only like, 7 years old at the time. So of course I had a little imaginary friend with me. However, I don’t think she was an imaginary friend now that I look back it. But that’s not the point right now.</p>

<p>Elizabeth would always tell me to never go into the upstairs bathroom at night. She said an evil man would take me somewhere really bad. And being a small child with an imaginary friend I listened to her. Here’s the thing, I was born with an underdeveloped bladder. So I’d wake up several times at night to go to the bathroom. Sometimes I could hold it enough to walk down the stairs and to the bathroom down there, where I felt safe. But sometimes I just couldn’t make that journey. </p>

<p>I cannot describe the uncomfortable feeling I felt every time I stepped foot into that bathroom at night. It was completely fine during the day. But the second I woke up to go to the bathroom at night I would get super scared. My heart would race, and the second I was done I wouldn’t even flush or wash my hands. I’d just put the toilet seat down and run. That’s how scary it was to me.</p>

<p>What I would do while I’m I was in there, I would stare at the medicine cabinet mirror door to watch the shower curtains behind me. I wouldn’t look at the curtains directly. I never wanted to because I had convinced myself that if I looked a monster would pop out and hurt me. Because that’s what Elizabeth said. </p>

<p>Now I think it’s still I was scared of a bathroom but when I went back to face my fear. I’m not proud of it but I joined some kids who were sneaking in at night. </p>

<p>The seconds I stepped foot into that bathroom that same childish fear showed up and I got so nervous. I froze. I didn’t want to go in any farther. One of those teens there at the time shoved me into the bathroom and closed the door. They didn’t know why I was so scared and were pretty drunk, so they didn’t know any better. I started to freak out. My heart started racing and I felt so lightheaded. I didn’t know how to calm down because the room was so dark, the electricity had been turned off because the house had been broken into several times and the people who owned the house wanted it to stop.</p>

<p>I started to scream and when the teen started realizing, oh shit she’s seriously scared, they opened the door and stopped me from jumping out the window in the bathroom. I don’t even remember getting to that window, they just said one moment I was banging on the door saying it wasn’t funny and then suddenly I was screaming and trying to open the window. </p>

<p>All I remember if the fear I felt and how tight my chest was while in there.</p>

<p>I thought I would be over that fear a decade later but I guess not. I will never go back to that bathroom.</p>

I was walking down our driveway from the bus (we live in a dense forest) and I stopped by the stream under the driveway as I usually do. Something smelled rotting around me, so I look around until I realize that on a branch of the tree above me there is a beheaded vulture. I was kinda creeped out, but not really surprised since rednecks in my area do crazy shit all the time. But what perplexed me was that it was on top of a tree. How did it get there? I decided to think little of it until two days after some of my friends and I decided to go trekking down one of our trails. We stopped in a clearing that isnt too far in, but we really didnt expect what we saw- a pile of dead birds, stacked in the center, all with their heads gone. I then told the story of a few days earlier to my friends, and we got the hell back to the house. While we were leaving, we saw something fairly large move in a tree, but it was too fast for us to spot exactly what.
When we got back to the house, I relayed the story to my father (he is a wildlife biologist) and he explained that sometimes Great horned Owls kill and take the heads off smaller Raptors in their territory. I never thought great horned owls were that big, but apparently they did this sort of thing sometimes. With that cleared up, We kept noticing dead vultures on the ground, but took little heed until spring, when it suddenly stopped. I guess momma Owl has a head collection to show her babies now.</p>

<p>it only happened during that very brief window of time as you go from sleeping to awake, as your senses sort of come back to you but you&#39;re not quite fully awake yet either, i would frequently hear someone whispering <em>directly</em> into my ear. i mean as if someone&#39;s lips were a centimeter away kind of close. strangely enough, upon recollection of these experiences, i could never decipher any actual words of what was being said, just the very clear vibrations of someone speaking that close to my ear, and a predictably empty room by the time my eyes would open. the first time it happened, i remember looking around for my mom (it felt so real i thought it was just her trying to wake me up or something), but it kept happening and nobody was ever there.  </p>

<p>i figure it could be my imagination, as people can have a lot of strange experiences in that inbetween state, but it happened so frequently that it never surprised me when it&#39;d happen, kind of like when you have a recurring dream, it just sort becomes a part of your life and you don&#39;t really think to mention it unless it comes up in conversation or something. but the vibrations of someone&#39;s voice that directly into my ear always felt very real. strangely enough, it&#39;s kinda stopped lately and i can&#39;t recall the last time it happened, but i know for a good several years there, it had just become a semi-commonplace experience at night.</p>

I do need to explain that my bedroom in this house was set as a door from the landing in, one bedroom, and then steps and a door leading into a smaller room that is attached to the main room. </p>

<p>a good 5/6 years ago I used to live in a house that dated back to King Henry VIII, and it was old and creaked in the night. one night I&#39;d chosen to sleep in my main room because it was too cold to sleep in the smaller room, and i was barely asleep when i heard the first door open, and then all of a sudden, i heard someone say &quot;boo&quot; gently next to my ear. at first i just smiled it off as i thought it was my mum and i just jokingly said &quot;boo to you too&quot;. now, i didn&#39;t get a response which is when i opened my eyes, there was no one there and my mums bedroom door was closed. all of a sudden i heard a creaking down the stairs to the smaller room. the door handle is quite hard to turn, but it squeaked as that door then flung open into the smaller room and slammed again. until the day we moved out, i would never ever sleep in that room.</p>

<p>I really do still think about it because it still confuses me and apparently freaks other people out when I talk about it :)</p>

So what happened was I got back from school and walked inside, at the time I was the only inside everyone else was either outside or somewhere else, and sat on the couch. After a few I got bored and went to go into my room; to set the scene really quick, the is five doors in the hallway of my room, the first two was the bathroom and closet (across from each other), the second to were my and my brother&#39;s rooms ( also across from each other), and finally another closet at the very end and center of the hall. Well, I went to the hallway and there was a shadowy female figure right in front of the center closet. I then quickly turned around and sat back on the couch. The second time it happened I was at my mom&#39;s house and it was around midnight and I woke up needing to go to the bathroom. I got up went to head to the kitchen area so I could turn into a hall where the bathroom was and as soon as I got in front of the doorway where the living room and kitchen met I saw the same figure sitting on the bench in the kitchen. I once again turned around and went back to bed.</p>

I jumped into my bed went under the covers and just didn&#39;t move for like 5 minutes. Completely frozen. Finally when i wasn&#39;t that scared anymore i didn&#39;t open my eyes just moved very little and tried to fall asleep.

I watched ET as a kid (around 4-5 years old) and ever since then I have been terrified to the point that I STILL (27 years old) have nightmares of him.</p>

<p>This starts out with a nightmare I had before I woke up. In my nightmare I wake up to scratching noises at my window. I shared a room with my little sister and she had the bottom bunk and I had the top bunk (I was about 9 and she was about 4) so I climbed down the ladder and moved the curtains and saw nothing. I closed the curtains and climbed back to my bed and as soon as I closed my eyes, I heard more noises at the window but it sounded like someone strumming their fingers against it. Again, I climbed down the bunk bed and looked out the window and saw nothing. I turned to go back to the bed but a red glow illuminated the room. I froze and heard something smash up against the window and I turned and came face to face with an alien. </p>

<p>This caused me to ACTUALLY wake up. I bolted upright and nearly smashed my face into the ceiling. After about 5 minutes I calmed myself down enough to lay back down. I was so distraught that I woke up my little sister so we talked for a few minutes before we both decided to go back to sleep. About 10 minutes into us trying to fall back asleep we both heard a scratch at the window and the leaves underneath it rustle. We both panicked and screamed for our mom. She came in and we were both crying that something was outside the window but when she pulled the curtain back she saw nothing. We both ended up sleeping with her and my dad that night. </p>

<p>Thinking back on it now, I believe it was one of our cats. In the middle of the night they would meow at the windows to wake us up to let them back it. But who knows.</p>

I sleep walk and this is the one time I remember what I was doing while sleep walking.</p>

<p>But usually I&#39;m home alone for a couple of hours and my mom wants me to text/call her every day I get home so one day I thought I was home alone and I&#39;m down stairs and I was going to call my mom.</p>

<p>But all i hear is loud foot steps on the kitchen floor and when your home and you hear human like foot steps you be scared. So what I did was I open the garage door and bolt out of the house to get away from what is in the house and I call my mom&#39;s full number twice while asleep and when you get a call from home when your at home its kind of freaky and my mom went out of her room and saw that my door was open and she knew that I was sleep walking. </p>

<p>So after i get outside she comes out and brings me back inside but when that happened I thought a person was trying to kill me when I heard those footsteps. PS THIS WAS ALL DONE WHEN I WAS SLEEP WALKING WHICH IS HERE IM ASLEEP BUT I CAN WALK BUT FOR SOME REASON I REMBER THIS ONE.</p>

When I was 11 or 12, I was getting ready for bed so I went to take a shower. While I was washing my hair with shampoo/conditioner, I noticed that the lighting in the bathroom had gone alot more dimmer than it was before. Then I noticed there was a shape of a figure on the other side of the shower curtain. Thinking it was my mom I said &quot;mom?&quot; and then pulled the curtain back a little. It was a shadowy skeletal-like human figure that had very little definitive features besides the dark red irises staring at me. At first we were just staring at eachother and then it lifted a shakey arm and pointed at me, slowly coming closer. I shut the curtain and was calling for my mom becoming more desparate in my cries the closer it came towards me with tears down my face. Finally my mom came in frantic asking &quot;what&#39;s wrong?!&quot;. After explaining I had her stay in while I finished rinsing my hair and now I always have a cat in the bathroom while I shower. I even still see this one and others in reality and in my dreams but that is more stories for another time.</p>

This house wasn&#39;t even a house when it was first made. It was two army barracks put together to make a house and I lived there for five years. What I remember to be a Saturday night I got up from my bedroom to get some water from the kitchen and as I walked past my back porch I saw the usual 7 to 8ft tall shadow staring in my direction but I paid it no mind because I saw it so much. (Bare in mind I&#39;m around 5 y/o at the time) I get my water and as I was reaching my door I feel as if something had caught hold of my boxers. I tried to unhook it from whatever it was caught on but there was nothing behind me. &quot;It was just caught in nothing?&quot;, I thought but when I turned around the shadow from the back porch was looming over me with the deepest darkest red eyes I have ever seen and before I could let out any sound all the lights shut off. In the darkness where the eyes were there was a white pale face with its mouth elongated so much it looked as if its jaw didn&#39;t exist and there they were the dark red eyes which looked to be staring into my very soul. I ran as fast as I could to my bedroom slammed the door and somehow fell asleep. The next day I asked my sister if she heard the door slam since we slept in the same room and her response was , &quot;What slam?&quot;</p>

<p>In sommer I always tilted my bedroom window at night, so that I get some cool air in my room. One night, I woke up at about 3 am to really loud banging noise. When I sat up in my bed and looked around my room, I saw what was making the banging noise. My window was slamming open and closed. I screamed for my mom and she came into my room closed the window and asked what&#39;s wrong. I told her that the window was slamming open and closed for some time. She just told me that it was because of the wind and went back to bed. The next day I asked her if that really was just the wind, she looked at me strangely and told me that she doesn&#39;t remember anything of what I told her and told me if that really happened it couldn&#39;t have just been the wind. I didn&#39;t leave my window tilted overnight for a pretty long time.</p>

When I first started working as a Dental assistant, I was told that the place is a bit &#39;haunted&#39;. Of course, these people are grown ups and I thought &#39;oh they&#39;re just messing with me&#39;. They saw that look of disbelief in my face and they reassured me that they all had some type of experience with the little girl that haunts the place. I brush it off and laugh at the idea. I remember it was a saturday around 2 in the afternoon, everyone had left already and I was alone in the front desk to finish mailing out cards for those who had missed their appointment. All but the front desk lights were off and I was listening to music with my earbuds. Soon I heard some type of bang from the front door as if someone wanted to come in, of course that was normal because sometimes there&#39;s people who want to come in even though we&#39;re closed but no one was there. I took off my left earbud just in case I heard anything else. I though maybe they had left after they saw it was closed and I went back to writing the cards. Just moments later, the lights above me were flickering and I paused for a minute. I was feeling a bit anxious at the thought of it because this only happens in horror movies right? But again this building has been around since 1899 and though maybe the lights just need to be fixed a bit. As soon as I got back to work, I heard the door from upstairs open and close. I stayed still and paused my music to see if any other sound was going to happen but that was the end. I had been done with the cards, so I grabbed my things and left. I was on public bus transport to my way home and thought about how I was alone during the time at the office. Everyone had already left and I made sure that everything upstairs was off. Not only that the door always makes some type of sound when one opens it and it takes force to open it. There is no windows open or capable to make sound and definitely no one upstairs to make the sound themselves. I had told my coworkers next time I saw them, they fully believed me. Now everytime one of my coworkers ask me to come along with them, I don&#39;t question. Even times that I&#39;m alone upstairs I feel terrified and always try to make my time as short as possible upstairs. We all have stories such as hearing chairs fall down, seeing shadows, door opening either upstairs or downstairs, steps on the stairs, figures that walk past the hallway. Can never get used to it.</p>

<p>Story 2: 
I was shopping with my mom 5 yr old brother at the time and I was around 7. My mom was trying to look for something and I was just playing around with my mini LPS figurine. As I was following my mom I saw this girl who seemed taller than me just stare at me. I pretended to ignore it and kept following my mom. She turned around to me and she has said she couldn&#39;t find what she was looking for, as soon as she said we were about to go, the same girl came up to my mom and asked her something. I couldn&#39;t hear and  I saw my mom just nod yes but with confusion on her face. I knew my mom wasn&#39;t very fluent and great at english. My mom noticed my brother had run out the store and she chased after him. I was about to follow when the girl pulled on my jacket and told me to follow her. I was scared at her persistence and I said no, I was scared because at the moment my mom had left and the girl was dragging me away. She kept yelling i stole her toys and I was just so confused telling her I didnt know what she was talking about. She was strong and managed to move me from where I was standing before but I started to grab onto some of the clothing racks and i didnt let go. I started to yell help and punch her arm, she lost some grip and by that I yanked my arm and bolted out the door. My mom was outside mad as to why I didn&#39;t follow her immediately but she didnt know until a fee days later. Every time I go back to that store I&#39;m always reminded of that day and ask what if I didn&#39;t have that rack of clothes there? What if my mother had known English better?</p>

Night terrors aren&#39;t just a nightmare, I would have vivid hallucinations of horrifying things in my room and I&#39;m my house. So this is the one that I can vividly remember: I was on my bed trying to fall asleep with mostly all of my lights on. I had gotten a replica master sword for Christmas and ever since then I would keep it by my bed for comfort. So I look over and I see my brother run down the stairs, stop about half way(my bedroom was to the left of the stairs) and I them come back up and peak the top of his head out just to the eyes. He stood there for a solid 25 minutes almost floating and looking at me with these deep blood red eyes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why I found this scary but he had some sort of black stick like thing, it was slim and long and he was just slamming it on the ground repeatedly. I eventually screamed for my mom because  he started to come fully up the stairs and when she didn&#39;t come I panicked and ran into my brother coming out of his room. Not from the stairs but from his room on the other side of the second floor. </p>

<p>Another quick on: I used to live in Utah. Me and my two other brothers slept on the basement and we had play room attached to our room. One night I hear a deep voice calling for me. Being the young 5/6 year old I didn&#39;t do anything, soon it started getting louder and closer so I started to run up the stairs and I ended up collapsing on the stairs due to being really fucking scared because the voice was so loud and was telling at me. I ended screaming bloody murder to the point that everyone on the house was up and someone had to cover my mouth and hug me into I stopped. No one was in the room, o slept with my parents for the rest of the week.</p>

I had just came up a hill and i see a man standing on my side of the road. He was probably 6 feet tall (which is tall compared to my 5&#39;1&quot; height), and was only had the clothes on his back. His arms seemed too long for his body, especially when he held his thumb up to me while i passed. I had to go into the other lane to not hit him, and when i passed him and looked through my rear view mirror, i couldnt see him. I had a sick feeling the rest of the way home.

We decided to go exploring underneath the bridge. It was very quiet and all we could hear was the water running and locusts(and various other insects). We stood still for a moment and suddenly heard footsteps approaching over us. We all froze. Each footstep grew louder and louder as it hit the pavement. We all stood still until we heard a deep voice (almost like an older man’s) yell “hey!”. My buddy finally decided to shine his flashlight up there and ask who was there. No response. We were scared and confused. When he asked again, still no response. We ran up there to see what the hell was going on, and no one was there. We didn’t hear him walk away, there were no cars around, and no trace of anyone there. We all walked home and every time I drive down that bridge I get chills.</p>

It was Christmas Eve and we were staying the night so we could do the whole Christmas morning thing with them.  My brother, sister and I were all sharing a queen-sized bed in the second guest room.  My brother was on the far side of the bed, my sister in the middle and I was on the side nearest the door.    From where I lay on the bed I could see into the living room and remember seeing my parents and grandparents all talking and watching the news and I was just laying there listening to them.</p>

<p>From the hall that leads away from the door and the living room, two figures stepped into the doorway.  They were solid black.  One was tall and, the best way I can describe it is, blocky.  Like how you might imagine the silhouette of Frankenstein&#39;s monster.  He just stood in the door, blocking out the view of the living room.</p>

<p>The second figure was about half his size and more rounded with a large misshapen head.   You know that saying, &quot;frozen with fear&quot;?  That&#39;s what happened to me.  I remember feeling cold all over.  Like I had an ice block in my chest.  Every muscle was just tense as it could get.  I watched as the smaller figure walked towards me, and reached out its hand.</p>

<p>When I felt it touch my arm, I freaked out.  I screamed bloody murder.  No words, just screaming.  My parents came running with my grandparents.  They told me I must have just had a bad dream.  I found out later from my brother and sister that I apparently suffered from night terrors as and little kid but I don&#39;t remember it.  I wonder now if this might have been what I would see during my dreams, and this time I just remembered it, or if it really happened.  I hope it was the former.</p>

<p>TL;DR  When I was kid I think I saw shadow people at my grandparent&#39;s house.</p>

I was just getting in to bed when I noticed a strange shadow of a mans head on my wall. I don&#39;t know why I thought it was off; I just didn&#39;t want to see it, so I called in my parents. They saw the shadow and proceeded to take down a lot of dolls and figures I had on my shelf to get rid of it. 5 minutes passed and all the toys were moved to the floor. The shadow was still there. My parents expiremented with their own shadows and the shadow head to try and see what made it. After 2 minutes of this my mother told me to stay in my brother&#39;s old room and she would sleep there instead. By this point I realized that the shadow wanted to stay and I didn&#39;t mind sleeping in that room. (I still don&#39;t know why I felt like that to this day.) However, my mother insisted and when I woke up the next day I went to check on her. </p>

<p>Her account: When I woke up I couldn&#39;t breathe properly. There was a weight on my chest that didn&#39;t leave for a while and I couldn&#39;t open my eyes. When it did leave, I was able to open my eyes and catch a glimpse of a dark figure leaving the room out the open door.</p>

<p>My first thought when I heard that at age 8 or 9 was, &quot;I should have stayed in that room. Mom wouldn&#39;t have been scared if I stayed.&quot; I had no reason to believe that and in fact I should have been glad to not have possibly experienced that. But even to this day when I think back to that night, I feel a guilt and regret of an opportunity I missed. I can not explain why I feel that way now or felt that way then. It is creepy to others, but not to me.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my only expereince that I still can not find a logical explanation for.</p>

Happened couple months ago, I was sleeping and thinking nothing will happen. Then all of a sudden my dream switches to me sitting on something and I feel someones hand on my chin, pulling my head away from neck, maybe to kill me? I then say to whoever it was , “you have no power over me!” And then i woke up. I have several stories just like this of even someone growling near my bedside- not being able to move at all. </p>

<p>This one time when I was 9, it was late at night and I was in my bed. I woke up and I looked at my window. I saw a figure of someone walking across my blinds and disappearing seconds after. Im not sure if i got up to look for the shadow, but i don’t think anyone could make such a shadow under a streetlight. I would’t know. But to this day, i have no idea how or why it happened. </p>

<p>Okay last one, this ones really freaky! So i was about 9 or 10 and it was my brother, my dad and me at home lounging around. I remember wearing my red oversized tshirt and some shorts because of this.So, it first started as rain and hail. Then, it quickly turned into mud spraying on our window down in the living room. I was pretty confused as to what was happening. Then it turned out to be some type of hurricane of sorts, that filled the whole house and shook it. All I could see on my sliding glass door was piles of mud being sprayed at it at god knows what speed. Whats freaky is no one else knew about it or saw it. It was just my dad, my brother and I. We all saw it. We all thought it was the strangest thing because hurricanes/tornadoes are not common at all where we lived. N now when i ask my brother if he remembers, he does not. He doesn’t believe me that it happened. It was the strangest thing ever to occur without explanation.</p>

I wanna tell you about a weird/scary experience I had when I was about 7 years old. I just moved into a new house with my parents when my grandpa recently passed a couple months prior. He was my world and losing him was very hard on me. For picture sake my bed room was right next to the top of the stairs and I had a night light in the hallway. My bed was up against the wall and the light was bright enough it lite up my whole room. Couple nights after we settled in I fell asleep facing the wall. I woke up randomly in the middle of the night and for some reason I felt a little on edge and my heart was beating fast for no reason. Now fully awake looking at the wall, I could clearly see someone&#39;s shadow peering into my room. I felt it knew I saw it and it quickly darted away from the door frame. I laid in bed terrified calling my mom and dad making sure it wasn&#39;t them checking on me... No response. Somehow I fell back asleep. I asked my mom about it the next morning and she said that they wouldn&#39;t have not responded to me calling. In some way I believe it was my grandpa checking up on me making sure I was ok.</p>

<p>When I was about 6 or something, I used to live in my dad&#39;s house. There are two closets in my old room, one that&#39;s really shallow and just had old old bean bag ottomans. And the other, walk-in closest with a mirror on the door. I used to go into that closest and read aloud to myself and whatever stuffed animal I brought in with me as well as what I felt was in there with me (probably can guess that this will go wrong). Eventually, my parents got fed up with this because I would be too tired for school so my dad took the light out of the closest. Being like most kids, I was scared of the dark so I stopped reading in my closet all together.<br/>
After awhile I started feeling anger ebbing from the door, which scared me from it more than the dark did. But eventually, I would go back to the closet. Apologizing as I opened the door, the anger had subsided just a little before something snaked around my wrist from the mirror. The door opened wide as more things came out of the mirror, I was scared stiff. Crying my eyes out as my legs and arms were grabbed, being tugged towards the mirror.<br/>
This where things get a bit fuzzy, I don&#39;t remember if I screamed or not I just remember my bedroom door swinging open behind me when there were only a few inches left between me and the mirror, and the light being slammed on. I remember falling back and landing on my butt, sobbing with bruises up and down my arms and legs while my reflection looked back at me in disgust. I don&#39;t know if it was my mum or my sister who turned my light on, but I know whoever it was, held me tight while telling me it was just a nightmare. Even tried convincing me I fell out of bed. (which would be quite a feat and specific roll to wind up in front of the bedroom and closet doors, that old room was one a bit big and two the bed was up against a wall too far from the doors)  </p>

<p>My parents would divorce after awhile, and I would only be at that house on the weekends sometimes. The closet would sometimes open by itself or slam shut when I&#39;d be there and I spent ages trying to get my dad to get rid of that mirror. To my knowledge the mirror is still in the house, the closet doesn&#39;t have it anymore but another bedroom does.</p>

We started to get uncomfortable so we started to walk away from him and back to our houses when he started to follow us. Every time we looked behind us he was still following us. It happened all the way home and we told our parents. I can&#39;t remember what happened after that but there were rumours of that man again and people were saying that he was a pedophile.</p>

Obviously I was extremely upset because he took us out to breakfast and the park or wherever we wanted to go every Saturday. After his passing some things got weird. When I’d go over the visit my grandmother I would always go up in the play room and when I did the rocking chair would always be moving while I played. The big mirror in my grandparents room had my grandfathers signature on it as if he wrote it in the steam from a shower. My mom was never able to wipe it off until it just disappeared one day. I can recall seeing him walk down the stairs leading to the living room and just saying “Hello Pappy!” and confusing everyone in the room with me. Time went on and everyone got older so to take care of my grandma we moved into her house. I’m now 18 and I can walk around the house and my grandfather lets me know he’s there by just slightly tugging on my sleeve like he used to.</p>

This happened when I was 7 or 8.</p>

<p>I woke up at about 3 in the morning, I had to piss reeeaaal bad, so I went to the bathroom. While I was going to the bathroom I heard an incredibly loud bang, I thought it was a gunshot, my bathroom was in my room and I was planning to run and hide under my covers, but when I passed one of the windows in my bedroom I noticed some strange lights outside, almost every police officer from our police department was there, and since there was so many, it confirmed my suspicion, I thought that “gunshot” was aimed towards my stepsister since the sound was so close. I thought my stepsister was dead. While I saw it all, I don’t know how, but I saw my aunt, I don’t know if it was a random image that my mind was making up or a ghost. I don’t believe strongly in ghosts but I still do believe. So that was a completely different thing they absolutely terrified me. After the image of my aunt disappeared, and I was hiding what I thought was safely under my covers, when I heard another incredibly loud boom, the officers outside broke into my house, but I thought it was a murderer or some terrible criminal breaking into my house, but when one of the officers ran up the stairs and into my room telling me to get out because my house was on fire, well, I got out. But when I was leaving my room, I noticed that the bathroom in the hallway was completely covered in flames. The loud sound I had heard was the third floor of the house caving into the bathroom. The way the bathroom was there was the room with the sink and the room with the toilet and shower/bath. And the room with the sink was the room that the third floor caved in on. So if i didn’t have a bathroom in my room, then I would’ve gotten trapped in the other bathroom, engulfed in flames, most likely ya know, fucking dying. It was mid November so here in Oklahoma it was freezing and my dumbass ran into the house to get my sliides Bc the ground was so cold. When I was in there, I could’ve sworn I saw my aunt again. We learned the next morning that my aunt had committed suicide. And we also learned that only about five seconds after I left my room, the part of the third floor above my room collapsed as well because the roof had fallen on it. Two close calls with death there.

I was being chased by this Freddy Kruger looking dude while he was riding a horse. 
After this nightmare and I woke up and went to my parents room and fell asleep. 
When morning came around I woke up and saw that same face in the corner of my room, both my parents were gone.
I was crying and screaming for help and no one came. In order to get out of the room I would have to walk very closely to that same corner where the face was. As I decided to run out of the room, I turned on the light in the process and noticed that it was a hat. A HAT.</p>

<p>it was night and I just came out my bed walking down the stairs while still watching YouTube.
I opened the door to the toilet while not looking where I was going and i suddenly felt a gray body and saw gray feet quickly I said sorry but there was nobody.
&quot;Huh weird&quot; I said to myself outloud but the weirdest of all was that i didn&#39;t feel any body warmth I was really close so should i have felt something.
then i went to bed</p>

<p>few weeks past at night I was on the toilet again with my focus on YouTube when I was done I came out of the toilet with my focus still on my phone just in the corner of my eye i saw the same gray feet and ran as hard as i can back to my room.
after all I that I never watched YouTube on the toilet at night again and i always have a flashlight with me.
also told my sister about this story and was scared too.</p>

<p>can anyone explain this I don&#39;t know what it was or what it wanted</p>

I PROMISE IT’LL BE WORTH THE LONG READ..... So when I was about 13 every year as a child my family would go camping for a week over the summer. This very specific summer we decided we would go somewhere new that none of us had heard of. Me being a child having no logical thinking into trying to look up this camp ground I just willingly went. As we got there I had a huge pit in my stomach. I had an awful feeling but I carried on as it it was nothing. That night after all the set up was done and we had had supper I still had that bad feeling and I kept feeling as if someone was watching us, as if someone was watching me. Later after regular camp activities such as s’mores I decided it would be a good idea to scout out a bathroom. As I was walking away from the camp site with my flashlight in hand I kept hearing someone walking but it wasn’t me so I stopped suddenly then hearing several foot steps after till they came to a stop I did that several times, looking around trying to find a source for the sound. All of a sudden I saw a black figure less than ten feet away from me and I ran as fast as I could, ignoring all goals I had my only goal was to get back to my camp site. As I got back I told my parents the story and they were skeptical.. but every time I’d try and go to the bathroom I felt suffocated and couldn’t go alone.. the next night my parents stayed up late and kept a watch out for what I kept seeing as I slept in my tent. Soon after I fell asleep I got woken up by the car starting and my dad rushing into my tent picking me up and bringing me to the car. My parents said after I fell asleep they were having a good time till they saw a shadow over my tent . A huge black shadow, they flashed it and it was someone in all black that then looked at the light , kinked their head to the side then disappeared as if it was never in existence. We left, stayed in a hotel and went and got our stuff the next morning and reported it to the camp grounds. They said they had heard of this figure many times the last ten years. I looked up the camp sight and there was murders there of a teenage children ten years before two young teenage siblings while camping and the murderer was never found.</p>

Around 3 Am I awoke to her still asleep but sitting upright pointing towards the front door hallway screaming, &quot;Baby choking, Baby screaming!&quot; Over and over again. Freaked out I looked towards that area of the apartment and there was a small area that seemed to be alot darker then the rest of the area that was lit up by the moonlight coming through the small windows on each side of the front door. 
Finally I got her to settle back down and go back to a peaceful sleep, but after that I couldn&#39;t. As time went on I noticed she would seem to be playing with someone she said was a little boy and figured she had an imaginary friend or something so I didn&#39;t think much of it. This became a regular thing and one day my daughter and I left for a day or two to go visit some family and my mom stayed home to watch my 2 year old cousin. It was her first time at our apartment and while she was there she would frequently stop in the front door hallway and start speaking to someone as if they were eye level to her. My mom asked her who she was talking to and without missing a beat said the little boy over there with the blue lips. When I got home my mother informed me of what was said and it immediately gave me the chills.</p>

Anyway, this happened to me when I was like, 7-8 years old. Back then I used to sleep next to my mom in their bedroom. This one time I just find myself waking up in the middle of the night, unable to move any part of my body. I could blink and breathe, but I felt that breathing became harder as time went on. Along with that, what seemed to be a shadowy figure manifested right into the corner of our room. It looked vaguely humanoid, and it had what seemed to be a grin drawn on its face. No eyes or other facial features, but it was just there grinning at me. It also felt like I was hearing some sort of white noise from my surrounding, but there weren&#39;t any TV&#39;s or radios that were left on. I felt sweat just running down my face as I tried to force any sort of movement from my body, I couldn&#39;t even speak to try and wake up my Mom. After god knows how long suddenly it feels like a weight is lifted from me and I could move again. The figure also and the white boise just all mysteriously went away as if they were never there. I immediately flipped the covers over my head and tried to go back to sleep. It hasn&#39;t happened again to me ever since.</p>

For clarity, when my bedroom door is open, I can see the stairwell which leads down to the main floor. As a kid, I&#39;d sometimes see a featureless shadow figure walking up those stairs, but it would always disappear whenever I blinked. Though this was a little freaky, it didn&#39;t bother me as much as the one very memorable encounter I had with a separate shadow figure. One night, while I was laying in bed, looking over at the stairwell, I saw a very tall, thin shadow woman walking up the stairs. Whenever I blinked, she&#39;d...reset, for lack of a better word, and start walking up the stairs again. At one point, I was so focused on watching her that I forgot to blink. She made it to my doorway and leaned in. It was dark but I could still make out some of her features. She was mostly bald, but any hair she did have was very thin and fine. She also had a very skeletal face and one other feature that I can&#39;t ever seem to forget. She didn&#39;t have eyes. Peering in at me, I was met with the sight of two empty sockets. It felt like I had looked at that haunted, sunken face for far too long. Finally, I blinked, and she disappeared. I haven&#39;t seen her since and I hope I never do again. I&#39;m still not sure what that was so I&#39;ve stuck to labeling it as one hell of a creepy hallucination brought on by my overimaginative, five-year-old mind.</p>

<p>When I was a teen, my mother and I went to visit my grandparents in Florida. They lived in a pretty quiet neighborhood that had 2 parallel streets with one perpendicular one connecting them (the two parallel were dead ends). One late afternoon before dinner, it&#39;s still light out so my mom and I decide to go for a walk. We go to the farther parallel street and pass a house very far back from the road with a bunch of thick palm trees surrounding it. When we turned around and walked past it again on our way back, there was this older guy with a dog. We say hi and have casual conversation for a bit and then he asks if we wanna see his property. I thought it was kinda weird but we figured that he was just one of those old people that takes pride in his curated yards or something so we walk up the driveway. We get to the end and he&#39;s like &quot;oh you gotta come in and see the view I have of the river from the back deck&quot; and he brings us inside. My mom asks him about himself and he says that his wife had just gone to the store to get dogfood shortly before. The only thing that got me about that was that I never saw nor heard any vehicles leave the neighborhood, and he wasn&#39;t wearing a wedding ring (which doesn&#39;t necessarily mean anything but).. The television was on really loud when we had come inside and he kept trying to convince us to stay trying to show us the rest of this house. Eventually my mother says &quot;My parents are probably wondering where we are, we were about to have dinner&quot; and we kinda quickly leave. I don&#39;t know if my mom thought something was sketchy about the whole situation but I sure as hell did. I had a very weird uneasy vibe about the whole thing from the start. The thing is that My mom has never mentioned it to anyone ever since, and I&#39;m kinda too freaked out to bring it up.</p>

<p>This is the first time I have ever shared this story publicly, mainly because I think it makes me sound insane, BUT WE ONLY LIVE ONCE. Time is ticking...</p>

<p>P.S. Sorry its so long. Includes a lot of detail to express the fear I guess.</p>

<p>Some Backstory:</p>

<p>For a really long time (ever since I was about 10-11, I am 16 now), I have suffered with Insomnia, Night Terrors and Sleep Paralysis. I naturally never get any sleep and usually never remember any of the terrors or paralysis. Until that one night.</p>

<p>The night started off slow, during this time, I didn&#39;t have Insomnia, I got to sleep super quickly. I just finished some homework, getting ready for an amazing weekend. I decided to relax a bit and watch some YouTube. I always make sure to NEVER watch anything scary or involve any jump scares, trying to avoid any chance of a nightmare or night terror.</p>

<p>10:30 pm. I finally put away my laptop on charge and plug my phone in, ready good nights sleep.</p>

<p>Within seconds, I was &#39;dreaming&#39;. I remember it perfectly to this day. I was in this empty field, sky was completely gray, what looked like an run down abandon hospital in the middle, the area surrounded by big tall trees, creating a perfect square barrier. I began to walk forward, dazed and confused, heading towards what I believe was the end part of the hospital. As I got closer, the more uneasy I felt.</p>

<p>The walk felt like it went on forever, I finally got near the corner of the hospital..</p>

<p>*BANG*</p>

<p>I heard a metal door swing open aggressively. I jumped and hid around the corner. I peaked around the wall to see what had exited, I was horrified. There was this massive man, his skin was gray and cracked, his arms covered in old black blood. He was carrying a big, bloody machete in his right hand, I assumed he was a butcher of some kind. The I saw something horrifying. I started to hear desperate screams, sounding similar to a bloody murder scream. I looked a bit closer, to see that he was dragging a man by his hair. I began to assume the worst.</p>

<p>He threw the man onto the ground, almost paralyzing him. That&#39;s when I saw the butchers horrifying face. His eyes were almost black and he didn&#39;t have any lips, his bloody teeth open to the world. He raised his bloody machete and threw it down to the mans neck, decapitating him cleanly.</p>

<p>I ran, I ran and ran and ran, not looking back once. I felt like I was going to throw up. Then everything just got so much worse. I looked up at the tops of the trees, only to what looked a trail of fresh bloody intestines. My eyes widened with shocked. I then realized that my body began to automatically follow the trail towards the front of the hospital. I heard heavy footsteps running towards me. I looked to were the sound was coming from, only to see a horrifying bloody clown, ready to attack me!</p>

<p>My eyes opened. I could see my blinds covering my window. I couldn&#39;t move, I couldn&#39;t speak. I could barely breathe, it felt like something heavy was sitting on my chest, despite laying on my side. I could feel myself begin to panic. I heard something coming from my window.</p>

<p>*Tap* *tap *tap* *clown like laughter*</p>

<p>Threw the small crack of the blind at the bottom of my window, I could see one of my worst fears. A deranged clown, his smile going from ear to ear, sharp bloody teeth staring at me, his big red eyes brightened by the uncomfortable whiteness of his eyes. He laughed and laughed and laughed. I could feel my tears cover my face. I began to scream with my mouth sealed shut.</p>

<p>I jolted up from my bed, screaming my lungs out. I looked around room frantically, it felt like something, or someone was still here. Nothing. I woke up my sister, who ran into my room and asked me what the hell happened. I told her everything, slowly released what had happened. My sister grabbed me a cup of water and told me just to breathe and maybe watch something that would calm me down and make me laugh a bit. I didn&#39;t sleep for the rest of that night.</p>

<p>The next morning, my sister booked me and appointment for the doctors, to see if they could help me. I went, there wasn&#39;t really anything they could do. But they did diagnose me with Insomnia that day.</p>

<p>Still the most terrifying night I ever had to experience. Still makes me anxious today.</p>

It was this older farmhouse right off of a main road. It tended to be noisy at all hours of the day, but I always seemed to feel a silent presence around me that I couldn’t explain. The basement scared me; it was dark and unfinished with a giant kerosene heater in the middle of one of the rooms. The attic contained a small living area and the bedroom my mom used to share with one of her brothers growing up, but it also had a multitude of small locked doors that led to what seemed like absolutely nowhere. </p>

<p>One time, when I was around 4 or 5, I spent the night. Everything seemed fine at first: I ate dinner, took a bath, brushed my teeth. Then came time to go to sleep. I stayed in my grandparents bed, huddled next to my grandma, and finally willed myself to go to drift off. A few hours later I woke up and opened my eyes. It couldn’t have been later that 4 in the morning. There was a girl, or maybe a woman, standing at the foot of the bed and staring at me. I wanted to cry or wake up my grandma, but I couldn’t. The woman was gone a little while later. I never spoke about it. </p>

<p>Years later, when looking through old pictures, my mom told me that her younger brother used to have an imaginary friend when he was younger. He said he used to see a little boy and his mom all the time around the house and didn’t stop seeing them until he was older. She makes fun of him for it to this day, without even realizing that this “imaginary friend” of his might have been trying to make friends with me too.

<p>There use to be a barn behind my house and about 50 years ago a man hung himself in it. </p>

<p>One night around 3 am I woke up. I was laying sprawled out in the shape of a star and my blanket was on the other side of the room. I look over and my phone is on. There is a message being typed to my dad (who I only talk to occasionally) that says “hi how are you”. I assumed I had rolled on it in my sleep and pressed the suggestions on the keyboard. I am slightly afraid of the dark and I am really freaked out at this point. I then turn on my flashlight on my phone. I am on my side so I roll over and I see a LARGE black figure standing over me. I pull the covers over my head as a first instinct. When I look again its gone. I turn on my light and I am up the rest of the night. I have had other experiences like this one living in my home (waking up to screams, slamming doors, etc). I assume all this is just the hangman paying me a visit...</p>

<p>When i was about 3 or 4 my mum and dad were out for a sort of date night so they called my aunt over to watch me and my younger sister who was only about 2.</p>

<p>She was staying in our with us, so she shared a bed with me while my sister was in a cot. I had a horrific dream about this weird shadowy figue so i woke up screaming, like full on toddler screaming. All the commotion woke up my aunt, obviously, and she was trying to calm me down saying stuff like &#39;its ok&#39; &#39;it was just a dream&#39; I turned to her with tears rolling down my face, almost shouting &#39;No the bad man, the bad man&#39; my aunt continued to try and calm me down when i shout &#39;No the bad man, he&#39;s sitting on the bed, tell him to go away&#39;</p>

<p>My aunt practically shit herself she moved us all into my mums room and we stayed in there insted. She still doesn&#39;t sleep over anymore.</p>

I was in 5th grade and my brother in 3rd. We were having a movie night on our own in the loving room while my parents drifted off to sleep with &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; playing on their tablet. 
About 10 at night, my brother asks me to pause the show and says that he doesnt feel good. I pause it and ask how he feels bad. He said that his belly hurts and I tell him to go to the toilet. He does and shortly after i hear puke hitting the toilet water. 
I rush into my parents room, halfway in the door and through saying &quot;[BROTHER&#39;S NAME] just threw up!&quot; when I see that they are both asleep. 
I didnt really know how to help my brother and not wake up my parents, so I snuck across the room to my dad&#39;s side of the bed and nudged his shoulder. Nothing
I nudge him again, &quot;daddy&quot;
Still nothing. 
I am about to shake him again when he wakes up, screams bloody murder, and flailed around for 3 seconds. 
At this point I&#39;m so startled I&#39;m about to cry and he cant see anything without his glasses, probably making my silhouette look demonic. 
It all ended good and we went to bed soon afterward.</p>

It was late at night, I was 9 or 10 at the time, and woke up for no reason. I decided to look at my doorway at the time( which I never do). Also, I don’t have a door, just a doorway. I look to see something starring back at me. It looked human, but also like a bat. It grinned at me with its horrible teeth, and slowly backed out of my sight. The next night, I wake up again to find it lurking once more. Again it backs off. I decided it needs a name( because why not at the time), nightmare was its go to. I then remember a couple weeks later where I saw it starting to emerge, so I turned on a light and could see the hand still dark, but back off as that had hurt it. Another night, instead of turning on a light, I turned on the radio by accident. I jumped to think there was more people there and ran off. Finally I had enough, so when I woke up, I looked in the doorway... except it wasn’t there, nightmare was smiling through the one window I had, waved, and left for good.</p>

<p>My second story(shorter too)
I was 13 at the time, and I woke up before my 5:30am alarm when I felt something on my chest. At first I thought it was a dog, but looking at it was far worse. I jumped but stopped midway so it wouldn’t attack. It had a long, black beard, crooked teeth, and red glowing eyes. I watched it for so long, I didn’t even know... until my alarm went off. The first triple beep went off, trying to watch and click the button. The second triple beep went off, mashing at what buttons I could find. Then the third triple beep went off, and I turned, smacked it off, turned back, and it was gone.</p>

We stopped at a gas station for a bathroom break and my mom stayed in the car with the dog while I went inside.</p>

<p>After I finished and was washing my hands, I heard commotion outside the door. I heard two people, a man and a woman, talking in a loud voice. I couldn&#39;t make out everything they were saying but they sounded aggressive.</p>

<p>Then I hear the woman say &quot;Yeah that&#39;s right! All the dimes and quarters!&quot;</p>

<p>At that point I was convinced there was a robbery going on and I had no way to escape. We only have one working phone and I left it with my mom so she could call my grandma.</p>

<p>Suddenly I hear a hard knock on the bathroom door. I didn&#39;t know what to do. Was it someone trying to hide? Was it one of the attackers? I could hear the woman laughing from the other side...</p>

<p>And I could VERY much hear someone say &quot;somebody&#39;s hiding in there.&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember why I decided to open the door but I did. And...</p>

<p>Everything was normal. Everything was quiet as if nothing had ever happened. The only thing out of place were the small line of people giving me dirty looks for holding up the bathroom. I quickly got out of there.</p>

<p>Obviously I just imagined it all, right?
But how did I imagine something like that? And why did it sound so real?</p>

<p>When I was 17, an anonymous sponsor paid for me to attend a Catholic youth leadership retreat in St. Paul, Minnesota. I wasn&#39;t intending to go when I was first told about it, but the cost was rather high, so due to the donation I felt obligated.</p>

<p>It was a nine day retreat hosted by a program called NET Ministries; I wasn&#39;t very familiar with them. Three other people from my parish went as well, two adults that I knew pretty well, and a girl my age whose family had been friends with my family for decades.</p>

<p>When we arrived, I was enamored, the city was beautiful, the facility was great, the people were interesting, and I felt a lot better than I had for a while. Over the first few days, I was sleeping well; I could feel the benefits of healthy meals and regular physical activity. I was actually having a really good time.</p>

<p>Everyone attending was broken up into small-groups, separated by gender, and each group stayed in a dorm room together. Other than me, there were two other youth and one adult participant, and our group leader - let&#39;s call him V.</p>

<p>One of the first couple days, V led our group to a secluded area, we were just going to talk about ourselves and kind of get to know each other. But one particular point V wanted for us to touch on was struggles we&#39;ve had - bonding over vulnerability and honestly, I suppose. I talked about a time where I felt very alone, I had friends that had killed themselves and I had considered it myself at the time. I was told that the group was a safe place, what&#39;s said here, stays here. Later that day, I was pulled into the director’s office, several of the staff members were there, but V was not. I was told that V had reported the conversation we had and they had called my parents. I was upset, I can understand their intent, but V hadn&#39;t tried to talk to me about it, or even really showed all that much concern during our group session - I felt it was a breach of trust. At this point, I was more careful around V and about what I said or didn&#39;t say.</p>

<p>Over the first few days, I learned which people I got along with, which ones I didn&#39;t - for the most part the cliques formed and I was on the outside. But there one girl there who I became friends with rather quickly. We hit it off immediately and were very comfortable around each other, kind of both feeling it difficult to join in the groups. We spent out free time hanging out, playing an old guitar we found in the chapel, and talking. Then suddenly she started avoiding me. I didn&#39;t understand, so the first opportunity that I could catch her before she ran off I asked if something was wrong - she told me that V had instructed her that she needed to not spend time with me and instead stay with the other girls.</p>

<p>Now I was mad. Again, I could see the intent perhaps, but it really felt as though V had something against me, and this moment of distrust brought a sudden wave of clarity about other aspects of the retreat.</p>

<p>At first, praise of worship session was just fun, high-pace music where everyone was free to move or sing as they wished. By mid-week, the staff was wandering the back of the room pushing those of us not interested in dancing and waving our arms in the air to be more involved. The lectures became more aggressive and enthusiastic. The language the staff used because more distinct and grandiose. Then one staff member explained how he could speak in tongues. Myself and a few others were amused at first, and skeptical, but it was clear he truly believed he could speak in tongues - and through the later praise and worship sessions he would raise his hands over his hand and speak gibberish. I started to take note of how few people thought it was strange or who were taken aback by it.</p>

<p>I saw the attendees, who at first seemed normal enough, following their lead.</p>

<p>The cliques broke down, now there was this amorphous collective of people who carried the bibles with them, their free time was spent in deep conversation or group meditations. The schedule seemed to be far stricter, the staff were sharp and assertive towards those who feel behind. And the acts of &quot;miracle&quot; behavior became active discussion.</p>

<p>I started to see a pattern that I didn&#39;t like. As the week dragged on, the atmosphere changed - the people changed.</p>

<p>This came to a head on the next to last day. At 4AM, were woken up by our group leader and ushered into the hallway - the other male staff members were wearing dark brown robes, the hallways were lined with candled - we were instructed to remain silent. They moved us out of the dorms, across the entry, through the auditorium, up the stairs, and into the chapel. There, two rows of chairs were placed facing one another with a isle that lead to the alter, where a lectern stood with a small stack of paper and a pen. I realized, only the men were here, none of the women were present.</p>

<p>We were instructed to sit in the chairs - one by one we told to approach the lectern, genuflect, and read the words on the paper aloud, then sign our names. It was an oath. An agreement to be a warrior of God.</p>

<p>One by one, each of the young men walked to the front, dropped to one knee, read the oath out loud, signed the name, and returned to their seat. When it was my turn, I walked up, and knelt down, but I did not read the paper out loud, nor did I sign my name, I scribbled something on the paper, folded it up and pocketed it. When I returned to my seat, the guy next to me leaned in and whispered, &quot;You were supposed to read it out loud for us to hear&quot;...</p>

<p>Once everyone had gone, we were escorted back to our rooms, but not before we were told explicitly - do not tell the girls about this, they don&#39;t need to know.</p>

<p>The final day, I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about it, everyone was acting like nothing had happened and everything was normal. But that supposed normalcy reached a crescendo that evening, I had been thinking to myself that this all seemed very odd, more than just a tasteless or overly-planned event intended to engage the youth, the staff seemed very invested in it. I found myself desperately pretending to be in the loop, acting as though I was experiencing the same thing as everyone else.</p>

<p>That night, we were brought into the chapel at the usual praise and worship time, but the chairs were stacked in a corner, no lights, no AC - candles lines the walls and there was a strong scent of incense. We entered the room and our group leaders took us all into separate areas of the room and sat us in a circle on the ground, both the men and women were here this time.</p>

<p>V began leading us in prayer and meditation. He told us about the grace of God and how utterly overpowering it is, he told us how we too could be - slain by the spirit.</p>

<p>He then walked away, grabbed a chair and placed it in the middle of the circle. He told the first member of our group to sit on the chair while we prayed around him. The man was early thirties, overweight, smoked a lot, and he was incredibly emotional - he would cry at the drop of a hat. So, a minute into the prayer, as V spoke out loud and asked God to touch the man and let us see him, the man&#39;s sobs were not unexpected. But I remember vividly the moment the man stopped sobbing. When I looked up and he was slack jawed, and wavering. Suddenly, he collapsed from the chair, myself as the other two youth were quick enough, and barely strong enough, to catch him - we laid him down and I reached down to check on him, he began to seize violently. Started, all I could do was hold onto him and keep him from hurting himself. My heart was racing and I couldn&#39;t hear anything else going on. A moment passed and finally he settled down. I turned to V, expecting shock, surprise, concern - he smiled. He stood, grabbed the chair, moved it a few feet away and sat back down.  &lt;Continued Below&gt;</p>

I looked around, I saw groups similarly with members laying down, them all shifting about the room. No one seemed scared; no one was looking around for guidance like I was. </p>

<p>Afraid, I walked over to the group and sat back down - I don&#39;t know what was happening, but I had to remain aware, and I had to keep hiding.</p>

<p>The next member of our group sat on the chair. A guy about my age, serious, stoic, and very proper - I was surprised how quickly he began to cry, how he toppled from the chair even quicker the first, and how violently he seized.</p>

<p>Again, V stood, moves the chair and sat back down. My heart was racing; I couldn&#39;t think straight, I couldn&#39;t qualify what was happening. But the third member sat on the chair. By now, the first man had woken up, again, I expected him to behave as someone who had just lost consciousness, concern, confusion, disoriented - no, he crawled to the group like he was perfectly aware, he was pale and flush - he sat down and continued praying, as the third sobbed, toppled, and seized...</p>

<p>V stood up, moved the chair and sat down - it was my turn.</p>

<p>I stood up, I sat in the chair, and no sooner had V began speaking - I felt the pressure. My vision ebbed, I could feel disoriented, I looked around the room and only saw willing participants. V spoke louder; I could feel fear welling up inside me. </p>

<p>And then I remember something. Something so random, why it popped into my mind, I still don&#39;t know. Years ago, my older brother had worked as a magicians assistant to a career hypnotist - my brothers words flooded into my mind like a tidal wave, &quot;You cannot hypothesize the unwilling&quot;!</p>

<p>Suddenly my vision came back, my mind was acutely aware of my surroundings, my breathing leveled out - it all made sense. Throughout the week we had been run ragged unknowingly, literature pounded into us over and over, words and phrases used in odd sequences during prayers - the room was dark, only candlelight illuminating us, the fire heating the room tremendously. Sat on the ground you couldn&#39;t tell, but the smoke and incense hung just below the ceiling, the perfect height to envelope you when sat on a chair.</p>

<p>We were lied to. In that moment I realized that the staff of this retreat had intricately planned a week of indoctrination, implantation, grooming - brain washing.</p>

<p>I realized that V had stopped speaking. I turned to see him staring at me, he said, &quot;I&#39;m disappointed&quot;...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember much of the next few minutes, we were dismissed. I walked out the room, I recall hearing some of the girls in another group laughing as I left. I walked down the stairs, through the auditorium, across the entry, down the dorm hallway, to the end of the farthest wing. No one came to this area, the stairway linking the guy’s dorms downstairs and the girl’s dorms upstairs had been locked, it was vacant and filled with spiders and dust. </p>

<p>I nestled myself as far back into the corner as I could, the spiders crawled about and over me, but I couldn&#39;t bring myself to move. I cried. For an hour I sat with only my thoughts, desperately trying to piece together what was happening - this sort of thing doesn&#39;t happen - but it does, it did. I witnessed cult behaviors; I was surrounded by people who had accepted the brainwashing, who had fallen victim to it. I remember pulling out my pen and writing on my arm, using an alphabet other than English, I pleaded, &quot;If this is what Godly people are, then let the Devil take me&quot;.</p>

<p>I heard footsteps.</p>

<p>One of the staff members was coming down the hall - all the way down the hall. I was fortunate, the man who turned the corner was not V, nor the director, but I still couldn&#39;t trust him. I hid my arm, I smiled - he said they had been looking for me, I responded that I needed time to meditate on my own. He smiled back, &quot;Good, everyone needs time alone with God&quot;, and he walked away.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any memory of making it bed that night, or sleeping, or waking up. The next thing I remember was being in the entry way, I saw the three members of church group there talking, I went up to them, I needed to confer with them about what was happening.</p>

<p>As I explained, they looked at me with concern, the two adults told me that everything was fine, they would know - they were members of NET. </p>

<p>I turned and walked away. They were willful participants. </p>

<p>Finally, it was time to return home. The flight back was a wonderful relief, to say I was scared of what else might happen would be an understatement. I managed to be seated alone, so I didn&#39;t have to be near the members of my church, people who from this point forward I would never end up speaking to again.</p>

<p>Once home, I kept all this to myself for nearly a year. I didn&#39;t really get along with my parents, but I was thankful that they were startled by these events when I finally told them.</p>

<p>I worked up the courage to talk to my youth minister, she was also my confirmation sponsor and she was the one who had told me of the anonymous sponsor that lead me to take this trip. She had always been there for me. When I told her about what had happened, she looked concerned, for a moment I was relieved, then she said, &quot;I&#39;m sure you must have misunderstood, things have been fine since I joined NET&quot;.</p>

<p>I began to distance myself from the church since then. I lost my faith entirely. I&#39;ve never been so scared in my life. Never been so alone. The distrust I developed and the skepticism of people&#39;s intention I began to live by is integral to me now. </p>

<p>A few months ago - I received an email from NET to an email address that didn&#39;t exist when I had taken the trip. They reached out to me asking me to come back. I never could get anyone that attended to admit that anything happened; I never could get members of the church to admit anything was wrong - I think about these events on a regular basis now. Just waiting, almost paranoid, always reminding myself - &quot;They can&#39;t hypnotize the unwilling&quot;...</p>

<p>One night when I was aroing 10 years old I was lying in bed in that state of sleep where you are starting to doze off but haven&#39;t quite fallen asleep yet. I was used to hearing dogs barking or foxes crying in the middle of the night but this night was different. In that inbetween place just before sleep I suddenly thought I could hear knocking on my window. I woke up a little to this knocking but quickly shrugged it off as being in my head when I heard it again but this time it was louder and more persistent. The knocking was then followed by a cackling sound which sent my flying under my bed covers. I hid there for a few more seconds as I tried to comprehend what kind of creature was trying to get in my window as the cackling and knocking continued until suddenly there was a loud flapping noise and the culprit was gone.</p>

<p>It turns out a rather large grey backed crow had been terrorising the house at all hours of the morning and night. I learned this after I told my father what happened and he told me how one early morning a couple of days before this he heard knocking on the sitting room window and when he went to investigate he found the perpetrator sitting outside the window cawing and tapping before it spotted him and flew away. This carried on for a few more weeks before the crow gave up and never knocked again.</p>

But two stand out to me. It might not be as scary as others, but it&#39;s still scary. I apologize for poor grammar and spelling. </p>

<p>One of them was when I got my first stray cat in my new house. We named him juju. I was getting ready to do to school. My family&#39;s bathroom is right after the stairs. When you get out of the bathroom and you turn right. Boom, there were a set of stairs to my open room. 
After I brushed my teeth I got out of the bathroom. I would always subconsciously look upstairs. This time I saw a cat silhouette with it&#39;s eyes closes. Thinking it was juju. I said &quot;well that&#39;s scary.&quot; But didn&#39;t think much of it. Until It opened it&#39;s eyes to that faint light reflected yellow color. I was taken aback &quot;that&#39;s more scary&quot;
I went to walk out to the living room, but the moment I turned around I saw my cat Juju walking towards me. My heart dropped. And I turned back to the dark stairs. The silhouette was gone. I never found out what it was. </p>

<p>The other one is a shorter one. I was casually taking to my sister in the kitchen. The kitchen is basically the hallway of the other part of the home. Literally the bathroom, laundry rroom(we don&#39;t have a basement) and the stairs to go up. The laundry room has a window to the outside world. It was night time so it was dark and the laundry room light was off. I was standing at a spot at the kitchen where I can see the laundry room window. When my sister was talking to me I looked at the window to see another silhouette, but this time it was a human with really short hair. Almost like a bobcut. The window was pretty high up. Only about 2-3 feet below the ceiling. I froze and stared at the silhouette before it moves to the side. Basically disappearing. It was really scary.</p>

This isn&#39;t my story but my mom&#39;s, who is also a huge fan of Unus Annus. This is what she told me:</p>

<p>She grew up and worked in the northeast mountains of Pennsylvania. She worked long hours after school and in her young adult years. It was natural to take the dark, winding roads through the mountains heading home from her job at the Elk Mountain ski-resort. They were old farm roads, just wide enough for one car, and were always traveled alone.</p>

<p>It was common for her to have nightmares of her times on the road, drawn from the pitch-black nights. In one recurring dream, it would be raining, and she would make one of the sharp right turns. Standing in the middle of the road, was a man in a raincoat. He was pointing at her, which she saw through the light of the headlights. Then she wake would wake up.</p>

<p>One late night, right after midnight, she was coming home from her shift. It was raining. And as she approached the familiar turn, she got an eerie feeling of deja vu. She turned the corner. There standing in the middle of the road, in the rain, was a man in a raincoat. He was pointing at her. As she looked around, she noticed his dog. It was his dog he was pointing at, not my mom.</p>

<p>She stopped the car, realizing that if she had been going faster, she would have hit the dog. He grabbed the dog by the collar and walked up the dirt road to the farm house. She never had that dream again.</p>

My mom would always force us to do this and would get mad at me and my brother if she came into our bedroom at night and our blinds were still open. I never understood why until she told me this story. This happened in the late 70s, when my mom was probably 7 or 8 years old.</p>

<p>It was the middle of the night, and my mom was woken up by a sound coming from outside her bedroom window. It was like a knocking sound on the glass, and she could also hear some rustling in the bushes. For some reason she liked to sleep with her bedroom light on, I guess she didn&#39;t like the dark. But this made it difficult to see outside at night. Something was obviously out there but she couldn&#39;t see what it was. So she stood up on her bed, and clicked off the light so she could get a better look at whatever kind of animal was in the backyard.</p>

<p>There was an old man staring into her bedroom window. </p>

<p>My mom said she closed her eyes for a few seconds, and then opened them again just to make sure she wasn&#39;t seeing things, or that she wasn&#39;t dreaming. But the man was still there, smiling and waving at her from outside the window, and he had this crazed look in his eyes.</p>

<p>My mom screamed at the top of her lungs and ran into her parents room, yelling at them that there was a man outside her window. They got up, tired and groggy, and they walked back into my mom&#39;s bedroom to see what all the fuss was about. The man was gone. They thought she had just had a bad dream or was seeing things, but my mom was adamant that the man was real. So her dad went outside to look with a flashlight, but he didn&#39;t find anything. There was no trace of anyone ever being outside her bedroom window.</p>

<p>Her dad came back inside, and told her that nothing was there and she was probably just seeing things and needed to go back to bed. My mom didn&#39;t sleep the rest of the night. The man did not come back, and nothing like that ever happened to her again again. To this day my grandparents just think that she had a bad dream, even though 40 years later she still stands by her story.</p>

<p>Short backstory; my whole life I&#39;ve been able to see ghosts. When I was 3, my mom had even heard me talking to my grandpa, whom had passed away before I was born.</p>

<p>I was around 10 years old at the time. For years, I had been seeing this lady that would appear in my room, and walk through the wall connected to my neighbors house. For a little while I thought it was my brain messing with me, until this night.</p>

<p>I had woken up, to the lady staring at me. As a short description, she had long hair, wore a dress, and looked pretty nice. I blinked the sleep away a bit, when I decided it was just another weird vision. However, as I went to turn away to go back to sleep, the lady started sprinting at me. And I mean full-blown sprinting. I was mortified, and being young at the time closed my eyes, put my pillow over my head and went back to sleep.</p>

<p>When I woke up that morning, everything seemed normal. I was laying in bed, when my mom called my name. &quot;[Laufeyson], come down here a minute!&quot; I went downstairs to my mom talking to the neighbor whose house the ghost lady would always back into. Mom said, &quot;Describe that ghost you always see to [neighbor].&quot; So I did. I said basically the same description as above, and suddenly my mom said &quot;Yep.&quot; Once I finished.</p>

<p>I was confused for a moment, before the neighbor told me, &quot;We see the same lady. [Neighbor&#39;s mom] and [neighbor&#39;s daughter] has seen her a few times.&quot; I was both relieved and horrified. Relieved, because that at least told me I wasn&#39;t crazy. Mortified, because I then wondered what would&#39;ve happened if the ghost lady reached me before I&#39;d closed my eyes that night.</p>

<p>Once I was at a friends and I went to take a shower. Her dad worked nights so he was usually asleep during the day so I had to made sure I was super quiet. Halfway through the shower I heard footsteps and I assumed it was her dad. Her house is old like mine with hardwood floors and they squeaked very audibly no matter where you are in the house. So, after I heard the footsteps I never heard them retreat back to the bedroom. Then the shower went cold, and I’m not talking about the water. I was under scorching hot water and I was shivering. I felt like someone was in there with me so I just randomly sang a worship song from a church I hadn’t been to in years(i am also not even super religious) but somehow it gave me comfort. I sang at a low volume so no one could hear me, and eventually I was able to warm back up. So I get out of the shower and everything is fine, I start to get dressed. </p>

<p>Let me paint the picture of how this bathroom sink looked before I say what happened. </p>

<p>It’s a long counter with one sink and a giant rectangular mirror that stretched the length of the counter and stopped a few inches below the ceiling. </p>

<p>When I was putting on my pants I looked up at the mirror and at the very top was a giant handprint. This thing was massive, the middle finger was longer than the rest and all of the fingers looked like they came to a point and there were droplets of water where each finger pad would have been. I ran downstairs and grabbed my friend and asked her if that was her footsteps I heard but she had been in the basement watching tv. Her dad also wasn’t home that day, he was out golfing. The mirror was so high up that it didn’t make sense for anyone to have touched it before and then the steam covered it. I have no clue but I do know that regardless it’s SPOOKY. I used to have photo proof but this was probably 6 or 7 years ago. I NEVER showered there again.</p>

<p>Edit: the best way I could describe it would be the handprint on the sheets in the movie insidious. With the long pointed fingers and the abnormal size.</p>

Spooks always seem to follow my family around, but I&#39;ll stick to the past two years. Something to note is I used to have extremely good peripheral vision for even the tiniest movements, until I developed more visual noise/floaters this year. I once caught a small spider crawling toward my foot, in the dark, on a carpet it blended into, when I wasn&#39;t even looking down, that&#39;s how reliable it was.</p>

<p>I live in an apartment with a couple of roommates, one who&#39;s used to pretty creepy sleep paralysis demons and nightmares. And one who&#39;s usually pretty sensitive to negative energies or vibes, for lack of a better description. Last year we thought stuff our roommate was seeing was just her dreams until I saw them too. There was one shadow she consistently saw pass by her doorway, completely unexplainable. By her door was a shared vanity for our bathroom then a short wall, then our front door to the left, important later. One night we were all in her room hanging out and as I was talking I saw a shadow pass by, at the same height, same shape that she saw without ever hearing her describe it. Another night I stood outside her door to have a conversation and saw something less than a foot tall and long like a dog crawl into the next room in the corner of my eye. Other roommate was never aware of these shadows and never felt anything.</p>

<p>Another night before any of this, I was brushing my teeth at our vanity by our hall nightlight when my roommates were asleep, and as I straightened up from the sink, a shadowy person glided past my left towards the front door and vanished. They were shorter than me, had a face I can&#39;t remember anymore, longer hair. I had blessed the apartment when we moved in, so I knew at least, that nothing wanted to harm us.</p>

<p>I sleep like a rock, but usually wake easily when someone else is moving around nearby. One night that year, around 3am, I woke up feeling the way I do when someone&#39;s nearby. I was facing my wall and quite wrapped in blankets, so at first I only noticed light from my computer monitor, which had been asleep, then I noticed someone&#39;s voice playing from my speakers quietly. I rolled over and saw that my computer had been turned on, and something had not only switched window programs I had left open, but clicked play on a paused youtube video I&#39;d been meaning to watch for a few days (it was a markiplier video, funny enough). My room was locked. I thought it was one of our ghosts but later realized my computer had probably been hacked. Regardless, I let the video play in the morning, just in case.</p>

I can’t think of what would’ve made me see that (no object was in that area that would result in such an optical illusion). The closest object was a dresser inside the room, and it was the same color as the skeletal arm, but the dresser wasn’t open (such that its door could be seen from where I was).

I was scared, I didn&#39;t know what to do - if I should do anything. He said something along the lines of &quot;I do this often. You just don&#39;t wake up.&quot; then left. </p>

I had never seen that elevator before in my life.  A few years later I was with my parents in that elevator and I had a full blown panic attack. I was hyperventilating and crying, it was horrifying.

1.when I was a child, I was completely back to my door&#39;s room when I used my setup computer. I remember I was watching a movie or something and my whole focus was on to it and suddenly I sensed  something was approaching from my side of head and, I just rolled my eyes to it to see what&#39;s going on and saw a completely white and kinda shiny hand and after that,I just fixed my eyes at my computer again, after seconds I realized what had happened I jumped out of my seat and looked back and I saw nothing, I ran off to my mother and told the story...she didn&#39;t believed me
2.It was a weird day at school cause every friend of mine attracted to ghost stories and telling about ghosts and demons and jinns, it was okay I was laughing with them and it passed. I came home that day and do my stuff the problem started at night time when I wanted to sleep I went to bed and just my mind decided to freak out that moment what if they are real and they come for me because I think about them a lot...and I couldn&#39;t sleep for 2 3 hours after I went to bed, still don&#39;t remember whether I slept or not but let me say even up to this day I feel it was real...I was laying down my eyes were closed and I felt two fingers flicked my forehead so hard and I opened my eyes so fast and looked around and there was nothing I don&#39;t know why but at that moment I decided to search around, my brother wasn&#39;t at home and my parents were sleeping so who done that?</p>

One of the nights after 2 dreams i wake up with sleep paralysis, one arm over my head, one to my side. I hear my parents downstairs yelling for me and I&#39;m guessing they just want me to do something for them so I try to go back to sleep. After a few seconds the yells become screams and my brother is there too. Then they suddenly become quieter and quieter until my brothers faint voice dies out. Footsteps then come up the stairs and closer to my room. For a second I get the feeling that someone is behind me before it grabs hold of my arm and puts a gun to my head. Then I hear an unfamiliar whisper in my ear saying &quot;Its safer for you if you don&#39;t move.&quot;</p>

<p>(When i told my dad that morning he said it might not have been sleep paralysis and instead a vision telling me to be careful but ik some people don&#39;t beleive in that)</p>

The house was built by a man for his wife. He had died in that house and the wife was selling it. It was a three bed room house. Two of the rooms were upstairs in the finished attic. Since originally was a one story house. Anyway, it did have side doors that you could open to go to the unfinished parts. Well one day I got curious and went to explore because I could. There was barely room to stand up since I&#39;m 6&#39;5 but I found some crazy things that the woman left there. Little slides you&#39;d put in a projector machine to show pictures and some creepy ass what felt and looked like porcelain dolls. I went through the slides curiosuly and held them up to a light. Was a happy family that lived here.</p>

<p>So I put everything away and went about my business. Soon then I would hear random voice and as well my door would click like it the knob was turned and opened very slowly, maybe 1/4 of the way. Sometimes I would feel a hand brush against my neck or shoulders if I was frustrated at a game or depressed cause I had real bad depression when I was a teen. It was oddly soothing. It soon became to get worse though. At times I&#39;d find the small side door open and a doll near it like it opened or the box if slides near it.</p>

<p>A few times I swear I could hear someone shouting and my heart would race or heavy breathing. It was when I moved my pc set up so my back wasn&#39;t facing the door. It never went away at all. Even sometimes I&#39;d go to work and come back and my laundry hamper was over turned and clothe all over.</p>

<p>I used to use headphones for games that I needed to hear well or speakers for casual games and I started to pick up weird noises like, &quot;We&#39;re gonna get him jon. We are going to get him&quot; which is horrid cause I did not recognize the low male voice at all and could only hear one side but as well my older brother name is Jonathan but likes to be called jon. At one time I was playing DooM. Old school ultimate DooM. I could hear loud screeching in my head phones over and over. I thought it was the game screwing up so I went to speakers and it did it against and gibberish almost a unearthly chanting and talking.</p>

<p>My parents never believed me, thought I was even crazy but I was a neat freak kid and as well as the dolls were always in the box even though I swear they kept moving, I could hear creaking at night because I&#39;m a heavy sleeper but if I can feel a presence or something around me, I can&#39;t sleep or I wake up.</p>

<p>Fuck that house.</p>

Some of my dads girlfriends family was over for Christmas. There was a boy my age who I started talking to bc I was lonely. We were hanging out till like 2am.  And at that point I thought I was going to pass out (I&#39;m weak I know) so I go to bed naturally. A few hours later I wake up to the feeling that I&#39;m being watched. I turn over in my bed and there is a dark shadow at the foot of my bed. That&#39;s scary enough as it is but then the shadow quickly jumps under my bed. I start freaking tf out bc who/what tf is in my room. Was I about to be stabbed or something?!?!? I click on the light and I start hyperventilating. I hear a voice from under my bed frantically say &quot;it&#39;s just me&quot;. And the boy from earlier crawls out from under my bed. Supposedly he just wanted to know if I was awake so that we could hangout some more. Once he left the room I noticed that my pants (that I left on the floor before I went to sleep) were hanging up on the door. I still have no Idea what his actual intentions were that night</p>

I have always been pretty imaginative and spending my time alone. But that week I was sick, had temperature and so on. And I was alone in my parent&#39;s bedroom watching TV. It was quite a big room, and we had a large bed. I was in the middle of it, getting sick of the channel I was watching. I wanted to reach for the remote which was a palm away from the edge of the bed. I can swear to my own life, it was not even nearly close to the edge. But this dark, almost gas like black hand reached out. It had spiky nails and it took the remote. Next thing I know I hear the remote fall on the floor. I was pretty terrified but I looked over the edge. And the remote was on the floor. I called my mom, to look under the bed but we didn&#39;t see anything. It was around noon this noon. I still wait for that hand to show up so I can find out what/who it was. I&#39;m 20 now.</p>

You following me so far? Good. Well in that kitchen we have glass doors that lead to the outside, and windows that also lead to the outside. Because it would be weird to have windows that lead to the inside.</p>

<p>Anyway, in this kitchen there is also a hob, and I am a human who has a stomach, so I like to eat food. My mum used to work a lot of over night shifts when I was a kid. So little 12 year old me was being a rebel and watching Hell’s Kitchen at 3am, knowing full well I would regret that decision when I had to get up for school. So little 12 year old me is independent, and doesn’t need no man to cook her food. So I head down and start melting some chocolate on the hob to dip pringles in.</p>

<p>But then I hear a bang. I assume it’s just my cat being a dumbass, so I just ignore it and hope for the best. Then I go over to the fridge to get some lucozade and I notice my cat is just staring at the glass door. And I’m like “oh crap there’s a demon in my house.” But if there’s one thing I learnt from Supernatural season 1 episode 1, it’s to never investigate. Mary Winchester did that and she ended up getting flambéed on a ceiling. </p>

<p>So I opened the door for the cat, assuming he wanted to go out and attack the neighbourhood children. But he just continued to sit and stare. By then my imagination was running wild, I was starting to think maybe my cat was a demon and had just tricked me into letting another demon into the house. So I shut the door, give my cat a dirty look because he’s an evil little betrayer, and bring my chocolate upstairs to watch Gordon Ramsey scream at people.</p>

<p>Nothing else happens for the rest of the episode, no demons steal my soul. Now I’m starting to get tired so i go into the bathroom to brush my teeth. As I’m brushing my teeth I look at the bathroom window to double check it’s closed. It was, but there were shadows on it. That would be normal, if it wasn’t a high up window with no trees surrounding it. And these shadows were the sort of shadows that you’d think were hands but were actually trees.</p>

<p>So I did what anybody would do. I went back to my room and fell asleep, and hoped that if a demon was going to kill me that they would be quick.</p>

<p>Not exactly scary looking back on it but 12 year old me was expecting death by supernatural forces</p>

This was two years ago and I was at the beach with my whole family. We were there for a couple of hours and everyone on the beach started noticing that there was what seemed like a lot of seagulls deep in the water just sitting there. It eventually got closer and it turned out to be tons of dead fish, and a couple of seals.  No one knows how they all died. Me and a couple of my cousins went into the water and there was this red tide. It was some type of ocean plant idfk. The dead fish was at least 10 feet from us  and we couldn’t see into the water cause of the plant things. But in the distance, right in middle of all the dead fish, My cousin Nick saw a shark fin. We didn’t believe him so we just stayed but we went a bit closer to shore. Like 5 minutes after a huge shark( I don’t if it would be considered huge cause I never saw a shark before) jumped out of the water eating the fish from below. Now til this day, I don’t dare step foot into any ocean knowing sharks can come out that shallow.</p>

When I was in elementary, about. 8 years old. I come home one day after school, walking into the garage, to see my sister and mom. Now this was normal, since my moms a stay at home mom and my sister is 2 years above me. Which in my school, middle schoolers get out earlier. Anyways, my sister was just there, peaking out from behind my moms waist. Both of them just awaiting my arrival. Or well, so I thought. As I come closer to them I see just my mom greet me, as I walk in. I think nothing of it. Assuming my sister had just ran off into the house to continue playing with her toys or something along those lines. What ever the case was, I asked my mom. After she was done greeting me. Where my sister was. Because, I wannted to play with her. However. The response I got was nothing like I imagined. Instead of my mom saying, &quot;Oh. She ran off into the bed room&quot; or &quot;Shes just finishing up her homework&quot; my mom left me terrified when she said. &quot;Oh, she&#39;s not in the house at the moment. Her library group had an activity day.&quot; That wouldn&#39;t have been so bad. If it weren&#39;t for the fact that me, my mom and my sister are the only ones who lives the house.</p>

I was a stupid and sneaky kid so I was able to sneak out of the house while my family was asleep.There are woods by the town and animal will roam the town sometime. It was a night I was outside coloring with chalks like normal five years old would do in this town but at night. I heard a howl and thought it was a dog so I look towards the nosie. It was not a dog it was a coyote and it was at the end of the street I lived on.  I was told about coyote earlier that year because my dog was kill by one. I slowly made my way back to the house and climbed in the window I used as my exit. I never told my family about it not even now. 
( Looking back I almost died in that town so many times)</p>

I was helping my sister build her bed, and we had a bluetooth radio on connected to her phone to listen to music as we made her bed. After a few minutes, my sister looked up at me and made a face, and asked. “Is someone in the hallway?” Confused, I glanced up and replied. “No.” She made a face like she didn’t believe me, and turned around to look out into the hallway herself. Immediately, as soon as she looked into the hallway behind her, the radio began to loudly crackle. It’s never done that before, and as soon as it happened my sister looked back at it with the same shock as I did. She even told me it’s never done that before. We both looked into the hallway once more to see if it would happen again, but nothing came of it. My sister then turned to me and said “Well that was weird—“ <em>SLAM!</em> Her bedroom door went from fully open to slammed shut. I jumped up and opened the door to peer into the hallway, no one was there. We hadn’t opened a single window inside or outside of her bedroom. We still don’t what happened to this day. My sister told me after that she had chills, and that was why she asked if someone was watching her. The radio never crackled except that one time and hasn’t since. I’m not a strong believer in anything supernatural, but I have no clue what happened that day.</p>

I’m a pretty paranoid person and one of my worst fears is waking up in the middle of the night and looking out my window to see someone staring at me. My bedroom window is in view of the streetlight on the corner of my street. One night I woke up at like 2 am and looked out my window, when I looked out there was a silhouette of a man under the light and he was looking at me. Frozen with fear we both stared at each other for a couple of minutes before he looked around, as if not wanting to be caught, and ran in the direction of my driveway. In the morning I told my parents and they checked the Ring camera... no one was apparently there. I know I saw someone though because I once I’m awake I’m truly awake and ready to run a marathon. Creepy dude</p>

<p>One night, I was awake at around 1:00 AM, as usual. I’ve never been the greatest sleeper, so I usually end up staying up. It’s a routine and has never effected me too much. It was a night like any other. I had my TV on, like usual, because I can’t sleep in pitch black darkness. </p>

<p>I was getting ready to go to sleep when I heard a couple loud knocks on my window. It wasn’t raining, or hailing, or windy. So I grab my phone and turn on my flashlight to look out the window to see if anything was there. I pulled up my blinds and shined my light, but nothing was there. I stayed up for another half an hour to make sure it didn’t happen again, and after nothing else occurred, I went back to sleep. </p>

<p>The next night, I planned on going to sleep at about midnight unlike the night before. The night went on like any other; I talked with my friends on Discord, looked at Reddit, drew, watched some YouTube, everything was going just as usual. </p>

<p>And then I went to go to sleep for the night. </p>

<p>I had just gotten comfy when I heard the door open. I immediately jolted up because I could see the hallway light wasn’t on and I couldn’t hear either of my parents in the hallway and it startled me. As soon as it opened fully, I saw a big, black, spider-looking object scurry into my room and under my bed. The door closed immediately afterward. </p>

<p>I was obviously extremely scared, so I got up and turned my light on and looked under my bed. Nothing to be found. So I turned my light back off and told myself I was fine. </p>

<p>I got comfy once again. At this point, it was already around 1:00 AM. As soon as I was about to drift off to sleep, I heard a couple loud knocks on my window again. Just like the last night, it wasn’t windy, or raining, or hailing. So I shined my light through the window again. </p>

<p>Nothing to be found.</p>

<p>So I made my way over to my bed again when my TV glitched and froze on a woman opening her mouth. So I turned my light back on and shut off my TV. I waited for around a minute and turned it back on. It reverted to normal, so I turned my light back off. </p>

<p>I went to sleep that night, sweating and nervous. </p>

<p>Nothing like that ever happened to me again.</p>

<p>The room I lived in had formerly been my big brothers&#39; so it was full of stored blankets and old toys and boxes tucked away, so I had little space. I slept on the bottom of the old bunk bed pressed into the corner with a nightstand, and I usually sat on a step stool by my nightstand using my bunk as a back rest. I had a small recliner chair but it was usually covered in art supplies and my cat used it to climb up to the top bunk. The top bunk itself had old blankets we never used and my giant stuffed tiger my best friend had given me for my birthday (probably the most expensive thing I owned at the time). It was pressed way back into the corner, sitting pretty.</p>

<p>One day I was sitting on my stool, drawing on my lap and I heard a creak up top, thought my cat was moving around or something. I called him but he didn&#39;t meow back or move again so i went back to drawing. Suddenly my giant tiger flew off the top bunk and landed in front of me on what little floorspace was left. I stood up on my bed not believing my little cat could have moved that on his own or thrown it, but ready to shoo him away anyways. There was nothing up there. My cat wasn&#39;t even in the room. No one else was home. I put the tiger back and went to draw in the living room instead.</p>

<p>A similar experience happened where I fought myself awake in order to move away from some grey doll/robot/whatever she was who was trying to grab my arm while I was in sleep paralysis, because I felt more afraid of her than I ever get towards that stuff.

Me and my friend was sitting on my front porch we were both sharpening our knives and having fun. Making jokes and cusing at each other like all boys do. Then all of a sudden we both hear a knock on a tree we both jump up. My friend started to curse under his breath. I was like &quot;dont worry man we hear that all the time nothing to be afraid of&quot;. We sat back down and kept sharpening the knives. 
The woods got quiet all of a sudden u could hear the frogs and water running. But you couldn&#39;t hear it anymore then a howl came up on the hill. This time my friend jumps up before I could even react. As a good friend he pushes me forward and I stumble. As I got up another tree knock was heard from the hill. At this point we were both shaking. &quot;We should go find out what that is man. Dont worry man itll be fine&quot;  I said.
We went up the hill with the knives pointing out ready to stab anything we c.(it wont do much but its something I guess) 
We didnt find anything or hear any more noises that night but that was the closest thing I heard to my house at that point.</p>

<p>A few years back, there was a Memorial dinner being held at my unit. I was working as a dishwasher, and was the only cook working that night,  because the meal itself had been catered in.</p>

<p>The unit had been built back in the 1920s, and had quite a few ghost stories that I at the time never believed.</p>

<p>All night I had been feeling as if someone was watching me, and just had this uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach. So naturally I was pretty excited when the dinner was over. I just had to lock up The Cook&#39;s office and turn in the keys before I could leave. I gave one last look around the office to make sure I hadn&#39;t forgotten anything, turned off the lights and locked the door. As I pulled the key out of the door, the lights turned back on inside the office and I could hear someone walking around inside the office. I was very confused because I swore I hadn&#39;t  seen anyone in the office before I shut the lights off. I knocked on the door a few times, and yelled for whoever was in there to open the door. When no one answered, I started to unlock the door.</p>

<p>As I put the key back in the door. I felt a finger press length ways against my ear and felt hot breath blow down my cheek and neck. As if someone was making a  &quot;shhhhh&quot; sound while holding their index finger against their lips, and pressing their finger against my ear.</p>

<p>Every hair on my body immediately stood on end as I whipped around to see who was violating my personal space. And there was no one. I was standing in an empty hallway, with no hiding spots or unlocked rooms to duck into. No one was in the office either.</p>

<p>Tl;dr I was locking up after work, and a ghost turned the lights back on... then shushed me for yelling at it.</p>

(there was a previous subway going to a different location aka the one he was waiting for.) he misses his subway and starts freaking out. he starts cussing but that didn’t scare me. he starts talking to the other people waiting for their bus (me and my mom included) and starts saying things like “hey lets play a game”, “how about witch doctor, you like it when we play with doctor huh?”, “tear your limbs off one by one”. i thought he might’ve been on a call or something but he had no phone or earbuds. my mom was listening to music so she couldn’t hear anything going on. i decided to text her because i didn’t want to be talking out loud where the man could hear us. she doesn’t believe me at first and doesn’t want to leave the train station but i somehow convince her to let us leave and we make it out alright. to this day my mom still doesn’t believe i heard those things. it still frightens me to this day.</p>

(I was 12 then but i still don&#39;t sleep very much) I was in bed just watching videos on my phone as usual. I start to drift to sleep and then i fall asleep. I then wake up and i see that the time is 2:30 AM and I couldn&#39;t move at all. I then start to hear crunching noises in the patter if rather slow footsteps and my door has a little crack so i hear the crunches slowly get to my door and stop. Then i see half a face. Long, Ridged, Slightly deformed face and it had yellow uneven teeth and had droopy eyes and pale skin. and had a octopus like body which had a texture of wood. This is a description of a monster i saw in the video right here  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAqBh5KDFgQ" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAqBh5KDFgQ</a>. Instead of it looking cartooney, it looked real and horrifying. It stared at me while slowly swaying left and right then it sped off in an instant and i could move again. I still didn&#39;t want to move in fear of bringing it back because i didn&#39;t know that i was hallucinating. I&#39;m 16 now and that still scares the hell out of me</p>

She lives in an old apartment with a wood exterior. One night my Yaya and father told me to go upstairs so they could talk and so I did. After about ten minutes of playing my phone I heard something but didn’t fully acknowledge it till I heard it again. The second time it was louder so I was able to hear it more clearly, it was a bang but I couldn’t tell where it had come from. So I sat there for another minute or waiting to see if it would happen again. Then about 5 or so minutes passed and it happed again. I looked in the direction of it and it was coming from the window and as soon as I looked over it started happening repeatedly <em>bang bang bang bang</em>. So like any normal person I ran downstairs and didn’t go back up the entire night😂</p>

In my bedroom I have my closet facing my bed. The thing about this closet is that both doors are mirrors. I often see things moving in the reflection out of the corner of my eye but it has never bothered me. Around 2 weeks ago I was sitting on my bed at night scrolling on my phone. I see a shadowy figure in the corner of my eye so I look up. There was nothing in front of the closet at all but in the reflection I could clearly make out a creature, hunched over slowly walking backwards towards the door. I don’t know how to describe the creature. It clearly wasn’t human. It’s face was long and animal like. It had a long snout like nose. Sort of like a demonic dog. It’s arms hung lose at its sides but were long enough to scape along the floor. It smiled at me, unblinking until it moved past the closet. I looked around the room and it wasn’t there. I know that the brain can fill the void in a dark room as I have tested this and know how that works.But I wasn’t staring into the darkness. I have always believed that my house is haunted but was never scared. Now I am.</p>

I always slept with my door cracked back then and I was old enough to where I didn&#39;t have a night light anymore, so the hallway was just pitch black. However, one night I was trying to fall asleep after waking up in the middle of the night. I was on my right side, looking out into where I knew the hallway was when I noticed a pair of bright, off-green eyes (similar to mine/ my dad&#39;s) staring at me. The eyes weren&#39;t glowing, so nothing around them were lit up; it was more like they were reflecting light. The only light source was from the moon outside my closed blinds, yet the pair of eyes were reflecting so much more light than the blinds would let through. I had a feeling that it was my dad, so I called out to him and asked, &quot;Dad?&quot; to no response. I tried again, saying &quot;Dad? Why are you here?&quot; to sill no response. I don&#39;t remember if the eyes moved away or not, but I ended up rolling over onto my other side and falling back asleep. I woke up the next morning and didn&#39;t say anything about it. I didn&#39;t say anything for years because I never realized how strange the event actually was. The only time I told anyone was when I was having one of those late-night, existential conversations with a couple of friends. They just agreed it was strange and then life went on. I don&#39;t know what I saw, or if I saw anything at all since it could&#39;ve just been a very vivid dream (I&#39;ve had plenty, so it&#39;s not out of the question), but I will always have that memory of 2 floating eyes in the crack of my door staring directly at me.</p>

The retreat was called “Close Encounters” and we had a couple of unexplainable things happen to us.</p>

<p>The night before the retreat we were picking up all the leaders so we can get the retreat center ready. We stop at one of the leader’s house and called her to tell her we were outside. She responds and said she will be out real soon. The door opens and we she her. She walks out a bit, waves and then walks back in and up the stairs. We thought that was a little weird since she didn’t close the door to her house. A couple of minutes later we saw her come out of the house but something was off. She came out from the first floor of the house. She didn’t come down from the second floor. We would of clearly seen her walk down the stairs since the door to the front of the house was open. She walked to the car and asked us why the door to their house was open. We explained what we saw and she confirmed that she was the only one in the house since her family went out for dinner that night.</p>

<p>During the retreat is where the scary stuff happened. During the night, the leaders would walk around to make sure no one was where they weren’t supposed to be. The retreat center, in the middle, has an open area where we can walk to the sleeping quarters. It has a nice garden and was a nice place to relax during the day. At night though, it was one of the freakiest places. For some reason, when we would walk outside the wind would pick up. It felt like someone running up to you and pushing you. It was that hard. Also the garden had all of these angel statues and every leader that I talked to, including myself, all experiences the angel statues looking at us. </p>

<p>The final experience we had was during a skit we would perform. It was a skit about three versions of the devil tempting Jesus in the desert. The skit was going well. We were inside and one of the walls was made from glass and we could see the cloudless sky. The last line of the skit is “Ever knee shall bow” and the three versions of the devil fall to their knees. At that moment, the sky turned black. Like for a split second, it was night time. Myself and a couple of leaders noticed this and we ran outside to look at the sky. There not a single cloud in the sky. No planes or any object that would see that could produce that moment of darkness. </p>

<p>Safe to say, we haven’t performed that skit since and we have never duplicated that retreat as well.</p>

This was a reoccurring event and I still have no idea what exactly was going on with me.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Story starts here:</strong> The first time I&#39;m aware of this happening was probably when I was about 4 or 5, which is as early as my memories go. When I would be laying in bed, trying to go to sleep, I started hearing things. It all started off quiet, almost like TV static that was coming from another room. The static progressed into voices, but still fairly quiet, and they never spoke words. Imagine being in a room with over 100 people who were all whispering to each other, it was like that. The voices got louder (more like closer, I guess, since they were still whispering, just louder whispering) until I couldn&#39;t hear anything except the overwhelming boom of hundreds of voices, male and female. It got worse, though. If I tried to listen or understand what they were saying, they&#39;d yell at me. If I tried to decipher any words at all, the whispers turned into full blown screams for only a second or two. Taught me real quick to avoid trying to understand any words.<br/>
Here&#39;s the weird part.<br/>
When I woke up the next morning, I would be throwing up with a fever. This always happened, without fail. Maybe once or twice a year until I was probably 10 years old, I would have a night like this and wake up vomiting and burning. Being young, I thought it was just some weird coincidence. By the time I accepted it as a pattern, it only happened one or two more times. By the time I got in the habit of thinking to myself &quot;I hear the people again, I&#39;ll be sick tomorrow,&quot; it had stopped. I maybe got sick one time after I realized it was a pattern before hearing the voices one final time and waking up without an issue. The last time this happened to me is when I was around 12 or 13, and it had gradually been happening less since we moved into our new house when I was about 8. Haven&#39;t experienced something like it since then, and I don&#39;t even have the comfort of calling it a placebo affect since I didn&#39;t correlate the two occurrences until they had basically stopped happening.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>So yeah, not paranormal (probably), honestly I have no idea what it was, but it scared the pants off me every time it happened. I still can&#39;t be in a loud area with lots of voices without having a massive spike in my anxiety.</p>

About 10 years ago, my family and I moved into our new house. It was built in the early 60s and had been barley touched since then, the house still had old rotary phones up on the walls. We had gotten rid of them all except one that was in the basement. A few months after moving in, I was watching tv when the phone rang, I decided to pick up the phone, and when I did, I could hear somebody talking to someone that wasn’t me. I couldn’t hear the other person, and they couldn’t hear me when I shouted ‘hello?’ about 100 times. They lady on the other side of the line was talking about how “mother has gone completely unstable, and she needs serious help.” After that point I got scared and put the phone back on the wall. Later that night I told my dad about the phone ringing, and he said it was impossible because that phone had been cut from the landline. I told him it rang and everything I heard when I picked up. The phone rang at random times for about a year and half after that, and I never picked it up, and eventually it stopped, but if you pick it up now, you can still hear the white noise a phone makes when the call has ended.</p>

They lived about 2 hours away from our home. Since their neighborhood consisted mostly of older people that don&#39;t really own technology or internet, we didn&#39;t have much to do. The little shit I was back then, I complained that I was bored the whole time, so my parents thought that it would be best to just hit the road and go back home. Half way back it started raining, my parents were pissed that I pretty much embarrassed them in front of our other family members and it was freaking dark. In one moment, as my parents were arguing, my dad missed a curve. He hit the brakes immediately and it took us about 10 seconds to stop. All of us got out of the car. That&#39;s when I saw that we had stopped about 10 inches away from a huge crater. Our brakes were helped by a bush that we hit right before we stopped.</p>

<p>Now I understand video game physics.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a weird dejavu exprience where I remember being in a place in a dream when I&#39;ve arrived there for the first time. Sometimes I confuse dreams with reality, and this honestly scares me because I dont know if my fondest childhood memories are real or not.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m probably not the only one with this fear.
I enjoy nightmares now because there&#39;s no way a nightmarish disfigured hell demon is real, and being chased is fun.</p>

<p>I know something follows me, not outside my windows or around the places I go. But always there with me, like a presence. I know I have seen him. And he&#39;s not a human, no he is too tall to be human. But he looks like one. The only reason I know what he looks like is because of something that happened a couple weeks ago. I was walking up my stairs and turned to my bathroom. As I walked past the mirror I turned to look in it. I could imagine the figure behind me, I could see him standing there. He was tall, crouching down slightly to fit in the room. He was all black, like a shadow, if he had a face it was covered with the darkness. I couldn&#39;t see his hands or arms but I know he doesn&#39;t have feet or normal looking ones at least, they are like spikes, barley touching the ground at the point, they are curved and make it so he could probably run fast, very fast. But I don&#39;t think he is bad. Sometimes he doesn&#39;t feel like a good &#39;person&#39;, sometimes he feels like he is there to help me. But I think he follows me, I think he is probably here right now. Maybe watching me write this. But I&#39;m not scared. I know he wont hurt me, I think he just wants a friend.</p>

I was bored and didn’t have anything better to do so l started downstairs to get a snack. I was almost on the stairs when I looked up and the classic “reaper” was there, except it was in all white robes and had some kind of animal skull for a head (probably cow). It had a pretty classic reaper staff with some animal skull on it. So I stop in my tracks and close my eyes for a few seconds thinking it’s my brain but it doesn’t go away. I try again and it’s still their. Still trying to keep myself calm I turn around and walk to the end of the hall then walk back to the stairs and he was gone. Needless to say I didn’t go get that snack.</p>

<p>I remember this story as clear as day and whenever someone asks about a scary, true story I tell this one.
Call it fake if you want but I remember this like it happened yesterday</p>

<p>I would have been about 7 or 8 i think and i was obsessed with watching ghost hunting programmes and anything creepy (that&#39;s most likely where my fear of the dark started). I&#39;d stay up late or set alarms to take up just in time for these shows to start. </p>

<p>One night, i remember being in a half asleep half awake daze, being pushed backwards in my bed by what felt like a super strong gust of wind. I knew it couldn&#39;t have been from my window because it wasn&#39;t open and the wind wouldn&#39;t have been that strong if it was. I could feel my hair flying around my face and i felt like i was being rocked back and forth. I looked up and was met with a large dark figure standing above my bed, not moving, not saying anything just standing there. Needless to say, i was shitting myself. I had no idea what to do and i was to scared to move away or hide. So i just lay there, staring at the figure as it stood above me.</p>

<p>After a while it disappeared and i tried to get back to sleep, but that strangely strong wind came back. It was stronger this time. I lay frozen in my bed, again not knowing what to do. After a while of staring at my walls and trying to calm myself down the toy pram i had in the corner of my room stated to move. It shook from side to side and move back a forth as if someone was there pushing it. I don&#39;t remember much else from that night, i don&#39;t even remember falling asleep.</p>

I lived on a street that wasn’t secluded, had nice neighbors and all a nice place to be. I was sitting alone in my living room watching TV, my mom was in the shower and my dad had left for work hours ago. Now the living room was behind the rest of the house, if you imagine the house a rectangle the front half consisted of various rooms and the back half was the kitchen and living room. Anyway, while I was sitting on the ground watching the TV some man knocked on the door only a few feet away from me, I don’t know who the man was, I know today, he wasn’t some like government employee coming to like check a landline or something bc he was just some guy in a black sweatshirt and old jeans. But at the time I thought he was my uncle Matt, but I was suspicious since my uncle lived on the other side of the state. Plus he never came over unless my dad was home. I almost let him in, he knocked again and I came up to the door where he then pointed down to where a handle would be suggesting I open the door. I was going to let him in thinking it was my uncle but something told me not to. He came out of nowhere, and I didn’t think this was my uncle. So I figured I’d let my mom deal with it once she was out of the shower. So I sat back down and watched TV, I don’t remember the man leaving but not even 2 minutes after I had sat back down my mom came back and the man was gone. I asked “who was the guy who wanted to come in, was it Matt?” And long story short after being questioned by my mom who this weirdo was on my back porch she realized I was serious and called the police. They came over and questioned me and I showed them where he was standing and gave a description. I’m not sure if the police asked the neighbors but they never found the guy or if anyone even see him. Thinking back on it now is scary, I was inches away from a man who probably wanted to hurt me, and if he really wanted to probably could have, the door was all glass, my family had one car and my dad took it to work, the guy probably thought no one was home and I was easy pickings if opened the door.</p>

A few years ago (when I was 16) my friend and I were obsessed and still are with exploring abandoned places. So we decided to visit our very first abandoned building: an old elderly home that was located in the center of our village and has been abandoned for almost 6 years. </p>

<p>We first tried to enter at the back of the building, but a creepy man scared us away. So we decided to enter the front of the building, risky because there was a hair salon across the street. We entered the building and were amazed by the creepy state of the building, there was glass everywhere. We were walking down the hallway( we were very scared becuzz this was our first building) until we suddenly hear a door opening and decided to run away. </p>

<p>The next week we decided to try again, this time we successfully explored the whole building, we even found an old elevator. But when we decided to go to the old kitchen, we heard something that sounded like loud breathing. We decided that we had our fun and wanted to leave. On our way back we saw the door that had opened the last time we had been there... but the door was gone, it seemed like it was kicked out, but there was not even a trace of old wood. </p>

<p>This may not sound creepy, but if you think about the fact that there is only a week in between these events... we never went back and they even started to demolish the building this year.</p>

Just for clarity’s sake: I and my family (my mom and dad) had moved from one country to another in the same year, so we regularly traveled back (by ferry, car or plane) to our home country (mostly during holidays). </p>

<p>So this time we decided to go home by ferry (it’s cheaper than going by plane and less exhausting than driving multiple thousands of kilometers by car) and from the beginning, we noticed that the ferry was packed unusually full with cars (some trucks were on the inside ship ramp) but other than that nothing seemed unusual.</p>

<p>So we go to our cabin, watch a movie and decide to go to sleep at it’s getting quite late. Right as we went to sleep we noticed the smell of smoke inside the cabin. While it might be strange, we just wrote it off as just some smoke coming from the exhaust tower and went to sleep. During the night we heard a loud bang on our cabin door. While truck drivers often get drunk and accidentally bump into doors, but this time it was a repeated banging, so we got up to check what was going on. </p>

<p>As soon as we opened the door we got a full face of smoke. We knew at that moment that there was most likely a fire on the ship and got dressed as fast as we could. We also opened the curtain above the window so my mom could get her phone from the windowsill, and we just saw flames right outside our window, so we ran out of our room (without any of our stuff) and went straight to the common area. The staff there were holding the doors open so that the people could get in as quickly as possible. Once inside we had to wait for the staff to open a door that would lead everyone to the rescue boats, but they couldn&#39;t open it too quickly because they didn&#39;t know whether there were flames on the other side of that door or not. While waiting inside we were just constantly hearing and feeling the explosions from the car tires. Once the staff got the doors open, everyone was rushed inside the rescue boats, women and children were prioritized. We were lucky because there was a police ship not far from our ferry, which meant that they could pick up everyone from the ship for some time. The bad news was that the small police ship couldn&#39;t hold that many people, but there was also good news because there was another ferry close to the police ship that could pick everyone up. Once on the ferry, everyone was given some free food and we were all brought to a navy station. There everyone was asked about what they saw and what they knew. We were given the option of going to our home country or going home. We decided to go home because my dad had left his wallet on the ship, so now he had no id and no driver&#39;s license. </p>

<p>We all got compensated in the end (for the items that burned up to a certain sum of money, and some money as ”moral support”).</p>

<p>But still, I was afraid to travel by ferry for quite some time after that incident, not to mention the images of people coughing and even vomiting blood (from the soot) while on the police ship, and the view of the ship going up in flames were some of the creepiest things I’ve seen in real life. And also the fact that there were no alarms nor sprinklers going off in the ship was horrifying. It meant that if not for the people that were banging on the doors, a lot of people would have suffocated and burned to death...</p>

<p>The good news about all of this is that no one died.</p>

<p>We still have a life vest from that ship now hanging proudly on our wall.</p>

<p>(P.S.: I apologize if I made any spelling or grammar mistakes, any corrections are appreciated!)</p>

<p>Also TLDR: a ferry that I was traveling on caught on fire and traumatized me for some time afterward.</p>

It was around October of the year 2015 when this began. I was feeling spooky and decided to watch some scary movies. It was raining hardcore and I didn’t want to turn on the lights so I lit up some candles. When I went to bed that night, I couldn’t sleep. It wasn’t because of the movies, I just couldn’t sleep. Around 3 am I was listening to music facing the wall. From the corner of my eye I saw my sister open the door and come straight at me and pulled my shoulder. I said “WHAT” pretending i was asleep. I looked around and nobody was there. I spent the rest of the night wondering what happened. I even asked her if she came into my room last night and she said no. A few months later I decided to take a nap. During the nap I see my mom open the door to my room and slowly walk towards me. My eyes aren’t open. I try my best to get up and open my eyes, but I’m stuck. She approaches me and reaches out her hand to touch me while saying my name. At this point I’m struggling trying to wake up. My body starts twitching forcing myself to move as I try to scream. I finally break free... my room is empty and my door is shut. This has happened three times since.</p>

<p>I was about halfway through this stretch and it was about 11pm. I had a sinking feeling since getting on the road that night, my bones hurt for no reason and my body felt numb. </p>

<p>I tend to look in my rear view mirror quite often already. I looked at my mirror, then back at the road. Nothing was in the mirror when i first looked but not even 5 seconds later a full view of a unmarked 18 wheeler was in view and gaining fast. I tried speeding up as fast as i could but the truck kept getting closer and closer. I ended getting to the first exit for it to pass me but if i never had done that it would have most likely destroyed my car.</p>

My mother being a religious woman had a baby jesus figurine. We never thought much of it but we would always hear a sound of foot steps running upstairs even when everyone was downstairs. One week we asked my uncle to house sit while we were away, he told us the weirdest thing happened to him while we were away. He told us that he heard the foot steps upstairs and went and checked but found nothing. He decided to close all the doors and head back downstairs because its probably all in his head. He hears the running upstairs again and goes to check, all the doors remained closed except the one to my bedroom. This isnt the only time this figurine did strange things. We would come home sometimes and it would be on the floor with a limb broken off. So yea that was my childhood</p>

<p>We don’t have a dishwasher in my house so we wash the dishes by hand in the sink. I was neatly placing the dirty dishes out of the sink and onto the counter. I distinctively remember placing all the cutlery in a large bowl so none of them would fall on the floor. I went to leave the kitchen to grab any cups that were scattered across the house when I stopped in the doorway as something hit me in the back of the right leg. I slowly turn around and there is a steak knife on the ground. (Luckily it didn’t cut me) I picked it up and put in back in the bowl. As I tried to leave the room again. I feel a gust of wind go past me. I brush it off as a window being open. Until I stop in my tracks completely as I hear a whistle in my ear. Not a whistle from a old window or a kettle. I mean the sound of someone whistling a tune to a song. I stood there for what felt like minutes until I felt brave enough to leave the room completely.</p>

<p>Another one isn’t really a “ghost” story but still freaked me and my friend out. 
Me and my friend were walking to her house in the dark around 9pm. We were dumb and feeling brave so we walked along the cycle path to get there. (The cycle path is surrounded by trees and is very lonely and deserted. Especially at night) we were walking in silence for some reason I don’t remember. We Hear someone run up to us from behind and I turn around. No one is there. Thinking that I imagined it I turned back around to my friend, who had stopped walking completely and was staring straight ahead. I didn’t know what she was staring at until I noticed the large figure standing about 6 feet away. Let’s just say we bolted and have never walked that way home again.</p>

<p>My scary(ish) driving story </p>

<p>On May 5th, 2018, my grandfather, his brother, my brother, and myself were driving on a small, two lane road in Lompoc, California. We were trying to find a place to park so that we could watch the launch of NASA’s InSight Mars Lander that would be taking off from the nearby Vandenberg Air-force Base at 4:05 AM PDT. The two lane road that we were on was incredibly dark, because it was about 3:30 AM with no streetlights and very little traffic. Both sides of the street were bordered by farmland. The only lights we could see were from the car’s headlights and from the Lompoc Federal Penitentiary in the distance. As we’re driving, my grand-uncle suddenly shouts, “Zombie!”. On the right side of the road, there was a humanoid figure standing in place. In the brief glance I got at them while we were driving, is saw that they were wearing blue pajamas that might’ve have white stripes on them. Everyone in the car was now confused as to what we actually saw, because we were driving through farmland and there were no houses nearby. Our best guess is  that it could have been someone who escaped from the prison, but we still have no idea who it was or what they were doing there. </p>

<p>TL;DR: We saw a “zombie” on the side of a rural road at around 3:30 in the morning.</p>

<p>To start off, I’m a lucid dreamer so typically when I’m dreaming and I don’t like what is going on I can change it. One night I was having a pretty normal dream ab my mom and I driving to who knows where but we got in a argument and my mom accidentally drove off a dock into a lake. I couldn’t get my seatbelt off and so I was drowning, which is usually when I can change the dream so I kept repeating in my head “I don’t want to die” except nothing was changing. I kept wrestling with the seatbelt and trying to breathe but nothing was working. At that point I was in full panic and had no idea if this was reality or a dream and all I could do was keep drowning. This went on for a few minutes until I “passed out” and finally woke up, gasping for air and sweating. I somehow fell back asleep and had another dream I was caught by a terrorist group and a man put me on my knees and had a gun to my forehead. An image of my girlfriend at the time flashed in my head and I again tried thinking “I don’t want to die” to change the dream but it failed me again and he pulled the trigger, waking me up. It wasn’t real life but the life or death situation, the realness of the dream, not being able to change it, and not waking up until I died was fucking terrifying.</p>

I remember once it was broad daylight and we had family over. My mom had asked me to go get something from her room but the house&#39;s layout was a little weird, basically you had to go down an L-shaped hall and along the longer side is where all the doors to the rooms were located and these 2 hallways didn&#39;t have lights or even windows so it was always very dark. So on my little quest I go into the first dark hall and then turn to go to the main hall and a couple of steps in this very vividly glowing green face-like mask comes out from the wall like something from spooky&#39;s house of jumpscares. I ran back and saw that all of my relatives were still in the living room or back yard. I went back to the hallway and it was gone.   </p>

<p>The second part to this tale I heard is from my dad YEARS later. He told us about how one night he heard a voice shouting a bunch of vulgar things in the living room and when he went to investigate there was large shadowy man causing the commotion (my dad&#39;s a pastor and his family used to be santeros (kinda like witchcraft) so he&#39;s used to seeing things of that nature). He confronted it and told it to go back from where it came and then he said it sank down into a shadow on the ground and started moving away. He decided to follow it through the house and saw the final place it stopped was UNDER MY BED. The next day he prayed and did some stuff to my room and things like that stopped happening in that house.</p>

She had the master bedroom in our upstairs, corner apartment. Whenever I would go in there, I just felt uncomfortable. It was almost unsettling for no reason at all. Shortly after my husband and I got married, she moved out. We moved into the master bedroom and it was really hard for me to sleep. I would wake up in the middle of the night either dripping in my own sweat, or freezing cold. There was one night in particular where I just felt extremely uncomfortable. I asked my husband to check and make sure the windows and doors were locked before we went to bed. He falls asleep in a record breaking .02 seconds, but I usually take a bit to catch the boat to dreamland. This night in particular, my heart was racing. After about an hour, I finally fell asleep. I woke up to what I, to this day, swear was someone whispering ,”ARE YOU AWAKE?” As if that wasn’t startling enough, it felt like a hand reached up under the covers and grabbed at my feet. I could feel the hand smacking the bed as if frustrated in not succeeding. I screamed and had my husband turn the side table light on and check under the bed like I was a three year old. To this day, he still thinks I’m crazy and I tuck the covers under my feet.</p>

I didn&#39;t know that that&#39;s what it was called. It was actually a few years later that I learned about it. But anyway, I used to control my dreams a lot and everything felt so real.</p>

<p>One day I started watching playthroughs of horror games. Some time later, I started playing the same games. I was obsessed with creepypastas as well. My favorite one was slender man. One night I felt something weird, so I woke up. I looked around my room, but nothing was there. I looked over to the door that was open (our doors are always open) and I saw a tall white-faced guy just standing there, looking at me. I blinked a few times and even rubbed my eyes, but he wouldn&#39;t go away. I got paralyzed with fear and didn&#39;t want to take my eyes off of him.</p>

<p>After about 30 minutes of just looking at him, I just fell into a coma, since I was really tired. In the morning I jumped out of bed and there wasn&#39;t a scratch on me or anything unusual. And I immediately forgot about it afterwords.</p>

I took my time for some reason. I turned on my bedside light and sat up with my feel on the floor, just waking up. My room was very small. Like at most 4x4 meters so my little light still lit up most of it. </p>

<p>So I sit there for maybe just half a minute and I look up because a weird color catches my attention. Now, I’m not a believer in ghosts but there it was. A cat. I did not own a cat at the time. It was a ghost cat... Just laying on my floor in front of some crates with toys. Not really threatening in any way but it’s eyes killed me from the inside. The cat was light gray ish and maybe kinda transparent. How you’d think a ghost look like. But it’s eyes... red glowing eyes looking straight at me. It hurt me. It felt like my heart was being pierced and slowly ripped apart. Took me a legit 2 min or something to be able to move and I went straight under my cover.</p>

<p>I cried myself to sleep and that lead me to a whole string of crippling fears and anxieties! Yay!</p>

Being a little explorer I was I wanted to explore the woods behind my house. My younger siblings wanted to come along as well so they tagged along. We walked about half a mile into our woods and found a white rectangular prism rock. To me at the time it looked like some sort of tombstone. Wanting to read it obviously I go to brush it off but the sun bleached it to the point where its illegible. So we put a stick in the ground to mark it to eventually come back with a paper and crayon to see if we could read it. On the stick we found a label to a water bottle to serve as a flag so if we were off a bit we can see it. Fast forward a bit we grabbed a piece of paper and crayon and about ready to go out. My mother asked what we were doing and told her about the tombstone. She goes quite like she kinda knew what we were talking about but didn&#39;t want to say anything. She just told us that its supposed to rain and come back inside when it gets too bad. So we go off not really to scared and made our way towards the spot. We reached where we thought it was at but couldn&#39;t see our stick sitting upright. We looked and eventually found it snapped and laying on the ground. We looked at the base of the stick to see if the tombstone was there but it was GONE... Dumbfounded we looked a little but more until we heard Thunder. Since we were told to come back when it rained we looked for maybe three more seconds until it started to rain hard out of nowhere. Scared we ran back to our house and realized we left the piece of paper and crayon out there but not to scared about it to go to the spot to grab it. The next day I go outside to let my cat out and noticed a piece of paper folded and a crayon sitting inside of it. I asked my siblings if they did it and they denied it instantly saying they ran. I don&#39;t know where that paper came from or who put it there, all I know twelve years later it scared the daylights out of me then and do now.</p>

<p>Tldr: Found a Tombstone that didn&#39;t want to be read and scared me and my siblings away.</p>

<p>Edit: 
Asked my mom about it and she said that this property belonged to my grandfathers side of the family for decades. She was told a story from her grandfather (my great grandfather) about the history of the property and how someone long ago built a cabin out there. They were a good family but it was a harsh winter. No one went out there unless it was them heading back with supplies. Yet with it being cold they had to keep the furnace lit. He guessed their furnace toppled over one night and burned down the cabin with them inside. For all my great grandfather new, when Spring came some of the family members went out to see if everything was alright. All that was left in the fire was some metal pans and the furnace knocked over. The family had a small service and to honor them a slab was left on the spot with the ages of everyone that was lost. My mother didn&#39;t believe in the story but she guessed that what we found might have been it.</p>

I had them every couple of nights for 2 years. Scared the crap out of me. </p>

<p>In these dreams I would be asleep or lying in my bed. I would be woken up or startled be a noise coming from my basement. It would almost sound like rattling chains. Then the sound of the chains would get louder and louder as if someone was walking closer and closer. Then it sounded like the chains were being dragged up the stairs. The noise would get closer and closer. Then I would hear the basement door creak as it was opened slowly. Then the door would slam shut. Then in the dream the next night it would happen again, only this time the noise of the thing in chains would step out from my basement and walk closer to my room. Closer and closer, then the sound would stop by the edge of the steps that lead to the second floor where my bedroom was. The light outside my bedroom turned on, then off. The basement door slammed shut. 
Then silence. 
On the third night the same thing happened. Only when the light outside my bedroom turned on the thing started walking up the stairs to my bedroom. The noise became louder and louder. Then I saw a shadow obscure the small amount of light that was shining through the crack at the bottom of my door, as if someone was standing there, just outside my bedroom. then my door slowly began to open. There through the door was the shadow of a person. Then the door slammed shut, I jolted out of my bed woken up from the terror the dream gave me, finally I was awake, there standing at the edge of my bed was the same shadowy figure with its arms outstretched, the door to my room creaked and slammed shut, and I woke up again. This time for real. I was drenched in sweat and my heart was racing. I couldn’t sleep the rest of the night. </p>

<p>It might have been from the lack of sleep but the last time I had this dream and was woken up, my bedroom door, that I always close before I go to sleep was open, and there through the crack in my door in the darkness it appeared as if someone was there, watching me sleep.</p>

Before I went to sleep I put a unopened soda bottle in the fridge for the next day and at the time me and my sister had bunk beds, so I had the bottom bunk. As I fell asleep, I woke up in the middle of the night for some reason. As I was look down my hallway trying to fall asleep, I saw a child shape figure run across the hallway to the kitchen. As I was freaked out and wide awake I heard scratching on my roof. At first I thought It was raccoon or squirrel, but it started laughing. I didn’t know what to think, but the next morning i woke up thinking it was just a dream, but when I went to the kitchen to get my drink, it was opened and half gone. I know it wasn’t my mom because she doesn’t like the flavor I got and I know it wasn’t my sister because she would have needed to step on me to get off the top bunk. I don’t know what I saw or heard but I won’t ever for get.</p>

My only regret was never telling anyone or even calling the cops about what happened</p>

They all happened in Naco, Arizona(right on the Mexican American border). At the trailer I lived in I had my own room with a window about 6-7 feet up and very commonly I would wake up and see a shadowy figure standing on the other side of the window, it would then turn and walk away(this is pretty common for spooky stuff). </p>

<p>The next story I will share is of a prank gone wrong. So me and my older cousins were outside chilling and looking at the stars. Our younger cousins were running screaming and just generally being obnoxious. We were tired of it so one of my cousins went to lure them to the back while me and the other cousin hid. When the small children arrived we made growling noises and jumped out at them frightening them to stay inside. After we sat on the trunk of the car and stared into space with the oldest of us three pointing out planets and stars and constellations. After he pointed out mars I looked and saw two glowing red lights just outside our yard. I got the others attention and said “hey, is that a truck?” (The lights were pretty far off the ground so I ruled out a car) the other two started freaking out. One rocked back and forth saying “it’s not real. It’s not real”  as the other just froze. Now me being the youngest of us three and seeing my older cousins freak out like that really scared me. I started hyperventilating and also froze in terror. Eventually the eldest I froze and grabbed both of us and took us inside, where we stayed the rest of the night too terrified to go back out. </p>

<p>The final story is not supernatural in any way, but still scary. The trailer where I lived had a rat problem, so whenever my dad would see one he would grab his rifle and shoot it. Well one day we were all in the living room watching tv and a rat ran through the kitchen. As my dad grabbed the rifle and began to take aim the lights went out. He took the shot anyway despite the fact that it was running. He hit it dead on and killed it instantly without even spilling any blood. My dad is by far the scariest man I know.</p>

<p>TL;DR my house had shadow people, I saw a demon, and my dad is scarier than them both</p>

<p>So basically when I was around 9 I was at my friends house, (who was 13) and I was next to him while he was an his ps4 playing on a game, I eventually fall asleep. It was 2 am and I wake up because I feel like I&#39;m being watched and I look to the closet and a man that looks about late 30&#39;s halfway in the closet staring at me and my friend sleeping so I elbow my friend waking him up and he sees them he turns on the light and low and behold a man is watching us my friend runs up to him and starts punching him (we knew it wasnt his dad because he had lesbian parents) and I start screaming waking his parents so they call 999 and apparently it was a man who had hid in closets and raped small children. If my sense of being watched hadn&#39;t kicked in. We most like would have been raped or worse.</p>

A few years ago maybe when I was 15, I had  sleep paralysis with an out of body experience. I don&#39;t remember what time it was but but I could see my body laying in bed, as well as a very large figure standing over it. Seeing this I didn&#39;t know what to do, but watch. Then as if the figure could a different presence it looked towards where I could see my body. I couldn&#39;t tell exactly but it looked like it was smiling at me, a grin stretching from ear to ear. It then looked back at my body and grabbed my by the neck as if it was trying to choke. Next it raised it&#39;s other arm and shoved it&#39;s knife-like hand through my chest. That was what woke me up. I then looked around to see if I could find it but nothing turned up, so I went back to sleep. In the morning While getting ready for school, looking in the mirror I saw a large hand reddish hand mark on on my neck like someone was choking me and knife like mark going through my chest.</p>

<p>This memory haunts me till this day.</p>

<p>S O My parents divorced Almost 4 years ago and when my mom and brother finally moved out of the house it was just me and my dad in a big house-- But after they left both me and my dad started hearing things, but the thing is only I could SEE things,, So one day im just sitting at our kitchen counter watching Marks videos and I hear &#39;my dad&#39; walking up the hall towards the kitchen so I hide behind the counter to pop out and scare him but when &#39;he&#39; comes through the doorway its not him at all, All I see are these feet walking through the kitchen towards MY Bedroom, the feet were black and smoky only going up to the mid calf, So I stay quite and stay hidden and when I cant see them anymore I sprint to the living room where my dad normally is. Turns out he&#39;s not even home. 
&lt;1 year later&gt;
Its like 2-4 in the morning, a horror movie turns on and my dads asleep on the other couch so Im like halfway through the movie and im Scared sh**less, im to scared to get off the couch and turn the movie off so I just watch it all the way through. After its over the TV shuts off because of inactivity so im scared, my phones dead, dads sleeping,  and the only light on in the house is the kitchen light so there&#39;s barely any light in the living room,,, so I try to sleep but my dumb self looks At the doorway. What do I see? The shadow of a man who barely fits in the doorway,, the shadow is just like the ankles from the year before all smoky. So now im even more terrified. I watch the shadow until i fall asleep, it never moves. 
&lt;Later that summer&gt;
I&#39;m laying in my moms old bed at 3 in the morning and Im snacking and watching Jacksepticeyes older videos. I finally get tired and so I turn  the lights off but leave the closet light on,,,, I lay there for awhile and then turn the other way. (There&#39;s no pillows or anything on that side of the bed) And gUesS whO I see??? The fricking smokey figure IN BED NEXT TO M E E!!!! So I just turn back around and lay there aGAiN until i fall asleep. 
Since then ive moved in with my mom and haven&#39;t seen it again.</p>

<p>First, we were having roll call in the staff office when the alarm for the museum on site goes off. This alarm is to stop people from breaking in (obviously lol) and it was my turn to look after the museum for the day. So I go in and check the doors, nothing out of place, they&#39;re all locked with no sign of anyone trying to get in. Then I open the temporary exhibition (another smaller privately owned collection of artefacts which gets swapped out every six or so months) and the door seems completely fine. Just in case I check all the artefacts and everything&#39;s in it&#39;s proper place.</p>

<p>Until I look up and three panels above the glass cases installed in the wall are open. Keep in mind that they are about 4 metres (13 ft) off the ground, and no one could reach it without a ladder, which we don&#39;t keep in the museum anyway and to open the door, you need to go through a series of steps in a specific order. To make it even worse I asked my managers if this has ever happened before, and they said no, and they hadn&#39;t seen anyone on the security cameras either.</p>

<p>The next day, I&#39;m in the museum again, and I keep getting tapped on the shoulder, poked in the back, and getting my clothes tugged, even when there&#39;s literally no one around me.</p>

<p>Now the third day is the real kicker. This time i&#39;m stationed up at the actual Stonehenge monument itself. To provide context, no one AT ALL is allowed within the stone circle and there are barriers set up everywhere, and the visitor path is a giant circle around the stones, with the closest you can get being around maybe 20 metres (65 and a half ft) away. There are four of us in total roughly north south east and west of the circle , all watching to make sure that nothing bad happens, like people hopping the fence or answering questions ect.</p>

<p>All at the same time, we all see a lady in a white dress walk into the stone circle and all at once we radio each other about the woman. of course it&#39;s a HUGE no no for anyone to be that close to the stones, even the staff, so we all move in from different points to box in the lady, we all draw close and there&#39;s no one there.</p>

<p>All four of us saw this lady at the same time, and we all moved in from different points of the circle, so there was no way that she could have run away without any of us seeing.</p>

<p>Slightly freaky, and I do have more stories, both at Stonehenge and at other historic sites such as stately homes which I have volunteered at.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve posted this in another thread but that&#39;s probably gonna get lost</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/g05744/my_scary_story_dads_house/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/UnusAnnus/comments/g05744/my_scary_story_dads_house/</a> </p>

<p>My parents had gotten divorced and as part of that both of them needed to get new houses (the one they had together was too big for just one person to pay for.) My dad had gotten a house and I don&#39;t remember where I heard this, but apparently the previous owner, a woman, had died in that house. I was only just starting kindergarden so I don&#39;t know who told a child this but it&#39;s stuck with me for so long someone had to.</p>

<p>A few things happened in that version of the house.</p>

<p>Once in the middle of the night, my brother called out &quot;Dad, I can&#39;t breath!&quot; and had to go to the hospital because of a really bad asthma attack. He&#39;d never gotten that bad before and hasn&#39;t ever again, it may not have been the house&#39;s fault but I have no proof to say it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>For me personally, I only had the uneasy feeling being there and had surreal nightmares. The one i remember the most was a dream where i was in a hallway with only a screen door, on the other end of the hall, that lead outside but i couldn&#39;t see out it. The hallway wasn&#39;t anything like how our house looked, everything was wooden, the floors, the ceiling. The walls i remember were specific in that they were half wooden boards, and then also had a decorative wooden paneling that was a darker red colored wood on the bottom half. But i KNEW i was at my Dad&#39;s house. It just.. felt like the house. It&#39;s raining outside and a light goes by like a car drove by, and mud got splashed into the screen. The mud phased through the screen keeping the shape it had been splattered on. And then practically hobbled towards me bouncing from one &#39;leg&#39; to the other. Looking back on it now it&#39;s hilarious to imagine but that dream made it feel so terrifying that i woke up from it. (it also was a recurring dream i had when at the house.)</p>

<p>The final thing that happened in that version of the house was that my cousin, who had been given a spare key to house watch while we were gone, took an axe and chopped up the inside of the house&#39;s front door, then stole alot of our stuff. He got caught and everything but I hadn&#39;t known what had happened until my dad told me a year later, and the image of the door with huge gashes taken out by the axe still scares me.</p>

<p>Now, my dad had that house demolished and remade, it took awhile but we finally got our house back. We even had a basement now too which was where my brother and I would play sometimes. The people who made the house apparently didn&#39;t add enough insulation to the basement though as we could pretty easily hear people talking upstairs if they were loud enough and they could hear us.</p>

<p>But one of the early days of having the house me and my brother were playing down in the basement when we both heard this woman&#39;s scream. Like she screamed as if she was dying and it was LOUD. My brother and I looked at each other and had thought the same thing; Who was that? My dad, at this point, had a girlfriend, so it might have been that she&#39;d dropped something and screamed. Or maybe the tv if they were watching a horror movie. So I went upstairs to check on everyone. The tv in the living room (closes to the basement door) was off. The kitchen tv was on but it wasn&#39;t anything scary. Both my dad and his gf were in the kitchen. I asked if they&#39;d heard anything and if everything was okay up there. They had no idea what i was talking about. They didn&#39;t hear it. I went back downstairs and told my brother. We decided we didn&#39;t want to play down there anymore for the day and both of us were too scared to go back to the basement until months later.</p>

It wasn&#39;t unusual for things being moved, hearing weird noises and seeing shadows. But one night when I was about 7, I was woken up by what sounded like something being thrown and shattering in the kitchen. Going to check it out there was nothing broken, nothing was even out of place. I figured I must have dreamt it and went to go back to bed. But as I going past the stairs, there was a blond hair lady in what looked to be an old white nightgown. You could tell she was crying but it wasn&#39;t until she turned her head when I saw half of her face was beaten and bloody by some kind of blunt force object. I ran scared to try and wake up someone to tell them what I saw but after realizing I couldn&#39;t get anyone awake I went back and the lady was gone. It scared me so badly that I didn&#39;t talk about it for over 14 years. It wasn&#39;t until one day when I was sitting down with some friends and family talking about weird things happening when my brother&#39;s friend who stayed over all the time had said something about seeing a blond lady in that house. Since I had never talked about this before it had both scared and amazed me when he was able to confirm every detail of this lady even to the crashing noise in the kitchen that woke him up the night he saw her. We were the only two that had seen her.</p>

I woke up and thought I had seen my brother so I yelled out to him to help me out of the boat til I noticed it was shorter than him and I took out my binoculars to see it clearly but it had disappeared before I got the chance to see it.

This a true monster, a man eater, impersonator, stalker. Many say this monster isn&#39;t real, but the encounter I have with this is surreal. My name is Erin, and the monster I am talking about is the one and only...Wendigo.</p>

<p>Something told me that something was off. I was in my house, lying down in my bed and being active on my computer. My mother told me to take the dog out, a little fat beagle basset hound around 12 years old. It was night and around hunting season up here in Pennsylvania, So random sounds happening in the night was all the normal with the poachers around. I live a small coal village out off a highway. My house isn&#39;t really that far from the woods, I&#39;m so close that if anything runs in the woods I can hear it.</p>

<p>I walked outside of the house to let the dog do his business when I heard a faint, but strong voice. It sounded like my father coming back from hunting, but he was already inside. my brother had not gone with him so I was the other strong person that my dad could rely on. I heard his voice call out to me, &quot;Erin, come help me drag [a deer]!&quot; I couldn&#39;t believe what I was hearing,had my dad gone back out to try and get something for the last minutes that he have had left? But, I&#39;d seen him in the living room chair as I was walking out of the house with the dog? I heard shuffling, pops and other sounds like broken branches that made it like something was dragging.</p>

<p>I knew my father was inside, as was everyone else in my family. my dog seems stunned, he looked at the woods in back of the house into the woods and the house again, like he knew that something was wrong. I remember the back to a time where there were video games made about this monster, what it would do, and how it would attract their victims. and all the other times that I&#39;ve gone out at night, there was no memory quite like this one because it hasn&#39;t happened again since.</p>

It was a warm night and my and my brother were looking at the stars above us. And than we saw a red star moving. First we thought it was an airplane, but the lights weren&#39;t blinking. Other people on the campsite were looking as well. Someone said that it was a flare, but my dad said that it wasn&#39;t coming from the coastline. Than the red light made a turn of 90° mid flight and was going to the sea and vanished into the clouds.
Other people on the site told us that this also happened 3 night ago and they notified the authorities, but they didn&#39;t know either.
What scared me the most was that usually an adult could explain everything that was unknown to me when I was a child. But no one had an explanation this time. I had some bad nights the following month.</p>

<p>So one time when I was like 13, i was on my computer in my room and I used to have a ceiling light with a dimmer switch. It was late at night and the lights were pretty bright. I don’t remember what I was watching but I was on YouTube. Eventually I noticed that the lightbulbs were flickering. I don’t know why but I got this unsettling feeling and was pretty freaked out. So, out loud I said, “stop...please stop you’re scaring me”. Then all of a sudden the lights dropped to the lowest brightness I’ve ever seen on the light. It doesn’t even naturally go there on the slider. Then I started to feel this low buzzing/humming noise. It started getting louder and louder till I couldn’t take it anymore. I was so scared that I ran out the room and  into my parent’s room. I told them what happened and they didn’t believe me. My dad said that the light was fairly new and if you put it on the lowest setting something can happen with the electricity and it could potentially flicker. So they calmed me down and when I went back to my room, the lights were normal again, my computer brightness was turned all the way down, and I realized the slider was at the highest setting the entire time...........OoOoOoOooOooOoOooOoOOoOOOOOOOoOoooooOooSPpPOoOoKKy</p>

<p>Growing up, I lived in a small logging town in Washington State. When I was a teenager, I would go for walks along a river near my house with my dog.</p>

<p>We went out for a walk around dusk. The sun was setting but it was still light out (it was mid-summer). We were about half way through our walk when I heard branches snapping to my side, into the thick forested area. I didn’t think much of it: a lot of animals live in that area. I figured it was a raccoon or an elk. My dog was pretty nonchalant about things like that normally, however this time she was definitely on edge. She was growling and angling herself in front of me. I felt uncomfortable, so we started to turn around and go home. The entire time I felt like something was watching me, even though whenever I looked back I saw nothing. </p>

<p>A few days later, we heard news of a large cougar being spotted a few miles away at someone’s farm. I was being stalked by a cougar. (Which isn’t paranormal, but for anyone who knows anything about cougars, is equally as terrifying).</p>

Just a heads up, there are mentions of murder and being trapped. No one was actually in any danger... I don’t think, at least. </p>

<p>In fourth grade I had to go to a program after school everyday because my parents worked late and couldn’t pick me up when school ended.
One of the rules of the program was that every time someone needed to go use the bathroom, they needed to take a partner with them. Ya know, in case they fell in the toilet or something. This program was held in the cafeteria, which was in the basement of the school. The building was almost a hundred years old, and all of the bathrooms were rumored to be haunted, especially the ones in the basement.</p>

<p>At the time I had a friend named Beatrice, but she went by Bea. Apparently she needed to go use the bathroom one day and I went with her as her bathroom buddy. As she was using the restroom, I somehow managed to jam the stall door shut from the outside so she could not get out, and then proceeded to tell her descriptively about how I was going to brutally murder her in the most painful way possible and make sure that no one would be able to find her body. She was crying and screaming for help but I had also shut the door to the bathroom, which was 1.5 inches of solid metal and was pretty much impossible to move as a fourth grader. (why the bathroom door was made like that I have no clue).</p>

<p><strong>I have no memory of this happening.</strong> I didn’t even remember going to the bathroom that day.
Bea was traumatized. She wouldn’t talk to me for a month. Our entire friend group hated me because of it. I still have no idea what happened. I tried emailing her a few months ago but she never responded. We never fully made up.</p>

<p>Other stuff happened in that bathroom too, but that was the only thing I ever experienced for myself. But I guess I didn’t really experience it, did I?</p>

<p>I had my 12th birthday party at a local campground. It was October in Alabama, so a good time for camping. I brought 10 other girls (one being my cousin) with me and we all stayed in one big tent. Night fell after a long day, and we were staying up decently late just talking and joking around with each other. Around 9:00 pm, we got an amber alert on the phones that some of us had, and being young it was scary but then we didn&#39;t think about it much longer. That night, there were two more amber alerts carrying the case of two girls. </p>

<p>It had gotten to around 10:00 pm, and most of us were still lively and talking. My parents, my current best friend&#39;s parents, and my younger sister were in other tents asleep. Then, one of my friends said she heard rustling outside the tent.  We stopped talking and then realized that the rustling was quite loud. We turned off our lights, wondering if it was an animal. The rustling only got louder, and my cousin freaked out and turned her light back on. It suddenly stopped. We were silent and sat there terrified. I directed my flashlight against one of the tent walls, and a figure resembling a huge man was seeable. A couple of us screamed, and I turned my light away, scared that someone was trying to get us. The rustling started up again, but this time got quieter. To say the least, we were pretty spooked and remembered the amber alerts from earlier. The next morning, my parents heard two more amber alerts and didn&#39;t tell us the news. I didn&#39;t find out until later that one of them didn&#39;t end up well, to say the least. Always be careful when camping kids</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a lot of paranormal experiences in my life, but here&#39;s the scariest. </p>

<p>One time I was in bed, at night, watching YouTube (Markiplier actually) and suddenly I felt something trail up my arm. Of course I think it&#39;s a bug or something and panic and sling my arm. I slung it in the direction of my closet which has belts and scarves on it. When I slung my arm, the belts rattled against the door. I stop and turn on the flashlight on my phone very panicked. I can hear the movement go around my room. I&#39;m a big time Christian so I grab my bible, read and pray, and turn on some Christian hymns. Eventually I sleep. In my dream, or better, nightmare. I can see myself watching YouTube. And then I see a creature reach up and drag it&#39;s finger across my arm. Get slung into my closet. And walk around my room. It moved in a weird solid but wispy type way. And it was tall and lanky and no fingernails and dark coal eyes. Then I see myself reading my bible. The creature watching me. I see myself sleep, and the creature crawls onto my bed and stares at me while I sleep. Really abruptly, it looks up at the angle that I&#39;m viewing my dream in. Like it&#39;s looking at me, grabs my bible,and throws it across the room, at my mirror, then runs out of my room. </p>

<p>I woke up the next morning. And there my bible was, laying next to my mirror. </p>

<p>then many months later, I had a sleepover. One of my friends where walking around my room when she suddenly fainted. When she woke up, she was disoriented and panicked. I asked her what was up. She described the exact creature I saw in my dream. Down to a T. </p>

<p>A few nights later, I had the urge to get up and look outside. I live on the second story in my house and I&#39;m right across from a window that is in the living room. And if you stand in a place on the yard, you can see into my room. I stood there and looked. There the creature was. Staring. And waving. 
I sleep with my doors closed now. At least it was out of my house.</p>

<p>So i&#39;ve lived in several houses in my life, but the current one and the one before it showed the most signs of creepiness, and i also get regular sleep paralysis</p>

<p>One time i was awake pretty late for my age (i was supposed to be in bed by 10) and it was around 2am. I&#39;d drifted alseep but snapped awake when i heard something outside, and it sounded like someone was walking right outside my window, but my room in on the second floor, and i have a little ledge under my window. i peeked outside, and nothing was there, so that was fine, but i rolled over and was about to go to sleep, when i saw a figure in the corner of my room. Now, my dad and brother are both tall, and i figured it was one of them, as it was a amle figure....but neither of them had a beard. The figure looked almost hipster like, a beard a fedora-like hat, and i could see glasses on it too. It said, in a raspy voice &quot;go to bed&quot; and i almost screamed- then he was gone, he didnt walk out, he just disappeard.</p>

<p>a week later i went to a sleep over at my friends house with a few other people, and they were all asleep, and i was sitting on the edge of the bed, i was wide awake, and the door to the room we all slept in was open, and the hall light was on. It was about 3-4am as well.Then in the hallway appearded the man i&#39;d seen in my room a few weeks ago.i shook my friend awake and they asked what was up, then they looked in the hall and asked &quot;who&#39;s there?&quot; ((they said they thought it was one of their family members and then went back to sleep)) the figure waved, and disappeardmy friend just went to sleep, but i was scared and stayed up all night</p>

<p>Later that morning, they said they didnt remember seeing anyone there</p>

<p>TL;DR: saw man in my bedroom, and saw him again at someone elses house, kinda creepy, but he looked like a hipster-  <strong>sorry my story is so long</strong></p>

My grandfather came to check on me in the middle of the night, as he did every night. That night, however, he saw a blue fog hovering around me. He stepped toward me to get a closer look. The thing looked up at him. My grandfather immediately tried to slam the door shut, but the blue thing was faster. It shoved its ghostly head through the closed door and said into my grandfather&#39;s face, &quot;What are YOU doing here?&quot; </p>

<p>My grandfather was always able to provide the details, like how the things head was triangular and how cold it felt to be near it. I&#39;ll never know what it was or why it was watching me sleep.</p>

The tree that fell broke through our roof in my parents bedroom and soaking their bed with rain water so we all went to sleep and the next morning we got some family members to come by and help fix the hole and being the five year old I was, I was curious on what the hole looked like so my dad carried me to their bedroom where the hole was and we were sitting underneath the hole for a while and I just kept waving at something. Just for your information before we go on yhere was no one on the roof at the time as they were all headed that way with no one showing up yet so my dad asked, &quot;what are you waving at Mike?&quot; And I remember tell him, &quot;a family, like ours, a mom and dad, a little brother and me.&quot; He said okay and brushed it off as me just having an imagination like a five year old does. About 2 or so minutes later he saw me looking up and laughing and he asked why I was laughing and i remember pointing up and saying, &quot;They&#39;re waving to me.&quot; So he said. . .wave back so I did then I started to cry and my dad asked why so I said, &quot;They left.&quot; and ever since I have heard and seen people walking around my house at night or heard whispers and creaking.</p>

<p>The historical house my sister lives in...</p>

<p>So my mother used to be the caretaker of a house that was built in the 1800s. The house was built in the woods in Des Plaines, Illinois and it is one of the historical houses. It was used as a red cross for the military and at one point was used as a children&#39;s hospital. When my mother used to live there she was pregnant at the time with my older sister. One time as she was sitting in the upstairs living room she would hear children&#39;s laughter and see little kids peeking around the corners like they wanted to play or something. This was only one of the many occurrences that happened at the house. Another time my mother was at the house alone waiting for her husband at the time to come home. She heard keys jingling like her husband was trying to unlock the door, but when she went downstairs to greet him no one was there.</p>

<p>The creepiest incident that occurred there was quite recent, maybe a year or two ago? A family friend came over with his two daughters. The daughters were maybe around 8-10 years old? The two little girls went upstairs while their father stayed on the first floor in the party room. The girls were upstairs for a while but one of them came down to join her father in the party room. The other girl was still upstairs most likely exploring the house. Although a few minutes later she came running down the stairs almost in tears saying there was a stranger upstairs. Apparently she heard someone walking around and she thought it was her sister coming back up the stairs to play with her. What she saw though was the same thing my mother saw years before, a little girl peeking around the corner wanting to play with them.</p>

<p>Every time I went to that house I personally never saw anything but I definitely got a weird feeling like something was watching me and my family. Also on the first floor of the house in the party/conference room, there is a women&#39;s and men&#39;s restroom and I honestly try to avoid the women&#39;s restroom on the first floor at all costs. I&#39;m sure nothing has ever happened in that bathroom but I always get the worst feeling when I go in there. I feel as if someone else is in there with me. I&#39;ve felt that way about that restroom since I was really little. Currently one of my sisters lives in that house with her father, they are the caretakers for the house now. One last really quick creepy fact about the house is that my mother&#39;s ex-husband was able to capture three different coloured orbs in a picture. The picture was taken in the party room of the house. There were two blue and one pink orb.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>A few years back when i was like 9 or 10, i was home alone because my parents where on a vacation without me and my sister was out doing what ever 19 year olds do.  So i was a weird kid who was scared of anything so i kept every light on in my house so nothing could &quot;hide i the shadows&quot;. What made it worse is that i  was watching Ghost Adventures all the day.  It was around 8 at night, and it was pitch black outside. I had every light on and i was sitting in the basement. My house had a alarm system that was set to beep anything someone open a door or window. And the alarm went off. I thought it was my sister coming home so i didn&#39;t think anything about it. After an hour after &quot;she came home&quot; i went to her room to see if she wanted to watch a movie. But she wasn&#39;t there. So i went on a journey around my house to find her, but i was all alone. I went to the alarm and it was deactivated so some had to come it and type the code in to stop beeping (cant be turned off from anywhere else).  So i turned the alarm off and went back downstairs and thought it was just faulty wiring or something. about an hour later i heard the alarm go off again so i went up stairs to check on it, and i was just going off. At this point i was really scared, and i didn&#39;t have any way to contact anyone. So i went to the alarm, and turned it off, and then all the sudden all of the lights went out in my house. Oh boy. I screamed but &quot;coolly&quot; walked to my basement to turn the power back on. The power generator was in the Landry room in the basement, so i walked to the door, then opened it to see a outline of my sister. I said something around,&quot; did you really need to do this?&quot;  but she didn&#39;t respond. so i turned around to make sure no one was &quot;watching me&quot; (i was really on my feet) and when i looked back, i swear the outline was gone. It was as if it wasn&#39;t there. So i ran to the power generator, and flicked the switches to see if the light go on, and one by one they went on. Later at like 11 my sister came home and i told her what happened. She didn&#39;t believe me (and so will a lot of you reading this). Still to this day every time i go back to that house, i never go to the basement.   I know like 90% of people wont believe this. But i swear it happened.</p>

One night I was getting ready for bed as normal, and I looked out my window at the street light across the road. At first, there was nothing unusual outside. So I left the room to get my dog. After I set him on the bed, I glance out the window to see that the light went out. I thought nothing of it... this wasn&#39;t uncommon. Until I got a closer look. There were two bright lights, almost like eyes, just staring at me. Whatever it was, it was tall, and it was just staring. We stared at each other for a good three minutes when the light came on again. Somehow it disappeared, leaving no traces. I immediately went outside to see where it went, but it was gone. I wrote it off as my mind playing tricks on me and went back inside. I had finished getting ready for bed but I couldn&#39;t get it out of my mind. After thinking about it for a while, I turned off the light and finally fell asleep. When I woke up it was still pitch dark out. The street light had went out again. Then I look up... There they were, two blinding white eyes staring down at me. I was too terrified to move. Slowly, the creature blinked, giving me a moment to grab the flashlight next to my bed. I turned on the light and a blur stared back before disappearing a second later. I didn&#39;t go back to sleep that night cause I was sure that it would come back for me. Whatever IT was.</p>

<p>when i was about 14, my friends and i all got together and to have a sleepover. we were super bored and made a ouija board out of cardboard and used a paint can opener as a pointer. i&#39;d never believed in ouija boards actually working so I decided to be one of the people with their finger on the pointer. we started off by asking &quot;is there anyone here with us?&quot; and I almost jumped out of my seat because I felt the pointer pulling in the one direction that me and my friend weren&#39;t even touching. it said yes so we proceeded to ask &quot;what&#39;s your name?&quot; to which it spelled out the name zozo over and over again. my friends started to get really nervous and started to tense up at the name so i asked who that was and they informed me that he was supposed to be a powerful demon. i started to notice that the room got excessively colder and I could feel a dark presence moving around the room. the dark presence I felt became stronger and I felt as if someone was almost approaching me even though I couldn&#39;t see anything. i felt something enter my chest and it felt HORRIBLE. i instantly felt like there was almost a poison spreading through my body that felt like pure evil and I felt like I was losing control of my body. I instantly started sobbing and clawing at my face for no reason (I hate crying in front of people so it was so unusual that I started sobbing in front of all of my friends). my other friend who had their finger on the pointer quickly moved it to say goodbye and I felt that evil presence leave my body. i later looked up more about zozo and found that a lot of people had similar experiences to my own which gave me chills. it was probably one of the most terrifying experiences i&#39;ve had to this day. please be careful when using ouija boards (or just don&#39;t use them)</p>

<p>Last Summer me and my friend (Helena) where at the local elementary school playground (don’t worry about why). We where sitting on the structure chatting away when we notice a car pull in (not in the lot but alongside the fire lane in front of the school). Now this very much freaked me and Helena out considering it’s about 6pm in the middle of summer break. The person who gets out of the car is dressed head to toe in white and goes to get something out of the trunk of their car. Helena and I are just closely watching this person while whispering what the fuck under our breaths. We are completely frozen considering the only way for us to get back to the car is to get too close for comfort to this person. They don’t go very far from their car just very slowly moving around, and stoping every few seconds. It is at this time my friend thinks it is a nun, which only freaks us out more. The person continues walk, stop and every once in a while bend over or kneel down. It is when this mysterious person has their back turned we make a break for it and sprint to the lot where my car is. We jump inside and lock the doors but we keep our eyes glued on this person. Being in the car makes us closer to the person we can see it is a women clothed in white slowing moving around the front of the school. She continues to every once in a while bend over. After watching her for about ten minuets we realize what is happening. This poor old lady was just trying to take her little dog for a walk.</p>
