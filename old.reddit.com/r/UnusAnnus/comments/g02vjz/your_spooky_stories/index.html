We&#39;d assembled and painted it downstairs and one night I finally brought it upstairs, placing it in front of my dresser since I didn&#39;t know where to put it yet. That night, I woke in the middle of the night from a very strange dream. When I opened my eyes, in the spot where my dollhouse had been...it looked like my mom was laying on the floor. I was very confused. So I said, &quot;Mommy?&quot; Instead of responding, the thing...smiled at me. It had sharp teeth and not human teeth. It continued to smile at me and didn&#39;t move. I was terrified. I covered my head with my blankets and tried to think of something else, because that was what my mom told me to do when I had a bad dream. I looked up again and it was still there, smiling at me. So I started screaming for my parents. It took a minute or two but they came running and they moment they turned on the light in the hall, the figure disappeared and it was just my dollhouse again.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>We&#39;ve since moved from that house, though it was certainly haunted. My sister saw a ghost once and the basement door wouldn&#39;t open one time. Definitely haunted. I also destroyed that dollhouse (it was cheap and wooden and I couldn&#39;t play with it without thinking of that night).</p>

Basically to sum it up I had a towel hanging over the side of the top bunk since I was on bottom and wanted to feel like I had my own space. The towel was a Dick Tracy beach towel and had a black shadow of him on it. I woke up and looked at the towel which was normal but then the shadow started to slowly raise it&#39;s arms upwards with an axe readying to chop me. It was so real and quite frankly I was WIDE awake when I saw that happening, that I tensed up in fear with my eyes squeezed shut and readied to get chopped. I waited what was probably 10-20 minutes before getting the courage to look but of course it was completely fine like nothing happened. To this day I prefer sleeping under my covers thanks to that intense moment.</p>

I woke up one night and I flipped over and saw a shadow right near my head. It was the shape of a human, so me being 5, just assumed it was my mom. I said &quot;mom? what are you doing?&quot; and it didn&#39;t move. I reached out for it and my hand went straight through it, but it didn&#39;t move. I started to sort of freak out but didn&#39;t think much, when i started getting up to check around it, it vanished completely. And not like it vanished in a smoke, it was like a card trick, it was there then it wasn&#39;t. To this day I still have no idea what it was, but shortly after that encounter we decided to move out.

My sister and her friend were bouncing on our trampoline, they wouldn&#39;t let me join them, you know how older sisters can be. Instead they said that I should just watch, obviously I wasn&#39;t going to do that, and so I went back inside. My mom suggested I go around with my school&#39;s sales magazine and try to sell some products, so that&#39;s what I did. When I came back however, I was confused when my sister asked if I had watched them or not. Turns out while I was out someone that looked like me had been staring at them through the living room window. They got scared when they went back inside and my mom told them I wasn&#39;t even home. </p>

<p>Tldr: My sister was being a jerk so a demon or something spooked her.</p>

About 20 minutes in, my sister gets a weird feeling and looks up to the window into the guest bathroom (mind you, the light was off) and sees a pitch black, darker than the dark of a completely lightless second floor, a clear outline of a head and shoulders. I looked up and saw this exact same thing. My sister starts freaking out and screaming stuff like &quot;go away&quot; while closing her eyes and we could see this bright light start fading from the back of the shadow. The shadow slowly faded away and we ran into the house to go upstairs to see that no light was on. This whole time we could see my mom, and my dad wasn&#39;t home. I still to this day have no idea what actually happened.</p>

<p>it only happened during that very brief window of time as you go from sleeping to awake, as your senses sort of come back to you but you&#39;re not quite fully awake yet either, i would frequently hear someone whispering <em>directly</em> into my ear. i mean as if someone&#39;s lips were a centimeter away kind of close. strangely enough, upon recollection of these experiences, i could never decipher any actual words of what was being said, just the very clear vibrations of someone speaking that close to my ear, and a predictably empty room by the time my eyes would open. the first time it happened, i remember looking around for my mom (it felt so real i thought it was just her trying to wake me up or something), but it kept happening and nobody was ever there.</p>

<p>i figure it could be my imagination, as people can have a lot of strange experiences in that inbetween state, but it happened so frequently that it never surprised me when it&#39;d happen, kind of like when you have a recurring dream, it just sort becomes a part of your life and you don&#39;t really think to mention it unless it comes up in conversation or something. but the vibrations of someone&#39;s voice that directly into my ear always felt very real. strangely enough, it&#39;s kinda stopped lately and i can&#39;t recall the last time it happened, but i know for a good several years there, it had just become a semi-commonplace experience at night.</p>

I could see and hear everything in real life but my vision was laced with creatures from my nightmares. So here&#39;s my most memorable story</p>

<p>One night I shot straight up in my bed in a cold sweat. I was nauseous, dizzy and I felt like I was being closed in. I got out of bed and walked put of my room. Everything was wavy and slow, almost like those cheesy &quot;acid-trip&quot; scenes in movies, but in black and white. As I walked past my parents room, door open, I saw dozens of dark, shadow figures reaching out towards me. They were thin with long wispy claw-finger things. At this point I thought that I was in danger, I started to sprint down the stairs which had a landing in the middle where they bent at an &quot;L&quot; shape. As I was approaching the landing I tripped and fell into the wall on the side of the landing. I turned around and looked into the hallway behind me, and it was filling up with black smoke, while these creatures were running through. They were headed right towards me, arms outstretched and I couldn&#39;t get up fast enough. I proceeded to just hurl my body left, down the second flight of stairs. I rolled down them, loud enough to where my parents heard me hit the bottom from the living room. I was laying on the cold hard wood floor with a stinging sensation on the front of my body and face where I landed. My body was incredibly heavy, but I managed to pull myself up. I stumbled through the rec room at the front of the house and into the living room where my parents were. They saw I was red, sweating, and breathing like crazy, so they tried to ask me what was wrong. I was in between the real world and a nightmare, so I was frazzled. As they were talking to me I could hear the worry in their voices. I was looking at them but it was like I was staring THROUGH them. I started screaming and crying, &quot;Help me! They want me! They are trying to take me! Please, I don&#39;t wanna go! I don&#39;t wanna die!&quot; They shook me for a split second after I said this and I immediately passed out in my mom&#39;s lap. I &quot;woke up&quot; sometime later laying in my mom&#39;s lap while my dad soaked my forehead with a cold, wet rag. After that they, gave me warm milk and a fresh brownie, and my dad carried me back to bed, where he rubbed my head until I fell asleep. Something tells me that he also stayed seated on the end of my bed for some time. I don&#39;t know how I know but I do. I woke up in the morning and it was like it never happened. It was the most extreme of my episodes but it was the last.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what this situation was, but from my research it was a combination of multiple things. I was a frequent sleepwalker and had night terrors. At some point I developed that thing where you get stuck in between, (I dont remember the scientific name for it. Starts with a &quot;H&quot; though.) and it went hand in hand with my sleep walking and night terrors. Just looking back at that night scares the hell out of me. Just be glad if you never had these experiences.</p>

<p>I currently work at a gas station in Roy, Utah. </p>

<p>We have a bathroom we used to let customers use until an incident that happened before I was hired. </p>

<p>One day the sewer system backed up and there were needles and drug paraphernalia strewn all the way into the street. </p>

<p>After that we closed the bathroom to customers and was only used by employees. </p>

<p>One night, I was working the graveyard shift and a man bought a love buddy. </p>

<p>”Love buddy” is a colloquial name for a little glass meth pipe that we sell. We get around the law by calling them ”oil burners”. </p>

<p>Anyway, after his purchase, the man immediately asked of he could use our bathroom. I let out an involuntary chuckle and told him, flatly, ”No. Sorry.”</p>

<p>There was a very brief discussion wherein he begged to use our bathroom and I adamantly told him no three more times.</p>

<p>He left without another word and I went through the rest of my shift as usual, listening to/watching Markiplier play ”Prey” at the time.</p>

<p>About 45 minutes later I went out to the bathroom to take a piss. It&#39;s about 10:30 at night so it&#39;s pitch black and there are no lights on that side of the building.</p>

<p>As I walk up to put the key in the bathroom lock, I hear a voice slurring, ”whos there?!”</p>

<p>I jumped out of my skin and pulled out my iPhone to use the flashlight.</p>

<p>I turned it on and saw the man I had seen earlier, but his eyes were sunken in and there was dried blood under his fingernails and all over his arms, as if he had been clawing at himself.</p>

<p>Underneath him I saw the meth pipe I sold him, black from having been burnt, and it had shattered when he sat on it.</p>

<p>I backed away very quickly and began to call the police when I was knocked over.</p>

<p>The man was howling at me and charging me. He was easy enough to avoid in his drugged-out state, but seeing a person transformed into a howling, violent animal by drugs was absolutely terrifying.</p>

I say this cause for half of 21 yrs of living ice seen the paranormal. I&#39;ve seen spirits, experience different things from them and have heard different names. Like one spirit who was friendly and actually really cool was I believe tim, excuse me for the name cause i dont quite remember the name that well but i believe it was his name. Anyway he was a really nice spirit to the point where we would talk and he would sometimes follow me. But he would warn me about the night time. At night he is no longer with me but someone else would be. So he would tell me try not to wake up at night for they shall come and see u. But I use to have nightmares almost every night. So vividly too. Some of them actually being a day that happens. But when I would wake up at night there were times I was lucky that nothing came. But when i wasnt lucky there was a creature. It would have a long snout and on all fours with eyes as red as blood and there teeth so sharp that pierce steel with ease. I would jus end up hiding under my bed and sleep there or my closet.</p>

Windows down, music loud, I was singing along and enjoying my drive, almost forgetting where I was. In the middle of a song, the music stopped, and the voice on the radio said, &quot;Stop! Stop now! YOU NEED TO STOP!!&quot; As I tried to process what was happening, I noticed I was coming up on the stop sign really fast, and I had to slam on my brakes. I skidded you a halt with half my car in the intersection. Just as I stopped, a large pickup came barreling through the intersection, failing to stop at their stop sign! Once the truck passed me, and my heart started beating again, the song that had been playing on the radio picked up where it had left off. Whatever metaphysical forces pushed their way into my car speakers saved my life that day.</p>

The year was 2018. Me and my brother were visiting my grandparents in Carson City Nevada for a month, and my mom had come separately to gain custody of our little sister (long story). One of the weeks we weren&#39;t out camping and my mom wasn&#39;t dealing with legal stuff, we all decided to hang out. (My mom, my brother, my mom&#39;s friend Bruce, our dog, Bruce&#39;s dog, and me) 
Something you have to know about Nevada is there are a lot of places that are haunted, a lot of people think this state might even be cursed. Since we had lived here most of our lives (we had moved away to South Carolina for about a year before visiting), all of the spooky stuff that has happened to us has pretty much only happened there. 
We decided it&#39;d be fun to go on hikes like we used to every other weekend. So everyone piled into the car including the dogs, and we were on our way. My mom&#39;s friend Bruce had heard of a nice trail that we had never gone on before, so we were excited to explore and take pictures. 
When we first got there it looked like any normal trail. And because of that years annual wild fire, I was excited to take pictures of the dead brush and Ash. As soon as we started walking things just seemed off, the dogs were hesitant, my family (who are very sensitive to the paranormal) including me, started feeling really weird. Like someone was watching us. 
While we were walking me and my brother kept hearing what sounded like radio interference, but the other two couldn&#39;t hear it. We kept going and found a kids blanket in the small Creek that ran under the trail, I pulled out my phone to take a picture and it was dead. I asked for everyone else&#39;s phones but theirs were dead too. My brother made the joke &quot;shit are we in a horror movie?&quot; And we all had a slightly spooked laugh.
We had just started to continue walking, maybe a few steps when the dogs started pulling on the leashes away from us trying to get back to the car. We tried to get them to start moving again when my mom said quietly &quot;what..? What the hell?&quot;
We all looked at her and she was staring up at the top of the mountain surrounding the trail. She pointed up towards the treeline, and under one of the trees was a figure swaying side to side. We all just stood there in shock because we couldn&#39;t figure out what it was. 
As we were watching, more started to appear, but they didn&#39;t walk up. It looked like their opacity was being brought up slowly. When there were five swaying in unison and a sixth one started appearing, we made the unanimous decision to nope the fuck out of there.
After we got back to our car, all of our phones powered back on at the same exact time scaring us a second time. The trip home was pretty silent other than the music playing on the radio.
Bruce went back a month after we had left and said he climbed up to where we saw the figures, and where the head of all the figures were would make them all around eight feet tall.</p>

I woke up in the middle of the night when I was about 10, feeling something crawling on me. You know that feeling you get sometimes, that a bug is crawling on you, but nothing’s there? It was like that. I went to brush the patch of skin to get the feeling to go away, but my hand hit something. I bit my lip, trying not to scream, and I brushed harder, leaning to my bedside table to turn on my lamp. All I saw was a spider scurrying away beneath my door.</p>

I blinked really hard a few times and it came into focus; it was a vespid wasp. Luckily it was later in the fall and my attic room got cold as fuck at night, so it was sluggish. I flung the comforter off in a panic (bad move, lost the wasp,) and since I couldn&#39;t find it, I just threw on the flip flops that were by my bed and stomped over every inch of the comforter on the floor. Lmao never did figure out where it went, but I definitely didn&#39;t go back to sleep that morning.</p>

My house was really new like just built new and on the stairs, there was plastic covering the steps. If you&#39;ve ever been to like a model house it was the same kind of plastic cover.  It was night and I was sharing a room with my sister. This room was right next to the stairs but just slightly to the left. My sister had fallen asleep and I heard someone walking upstairs. I knew it had to be someone because you could hear the crunch of the plastic every time they took a step. You just couldn&#39;t climb those stairs quietly. The door was ajar so I assumed it was one of my parents and so I looked out waiting for them to pass by the door but the sound kept getting louder and closer even though no one ever came up the stairs. It got to the point where if one of my parents were walking up there I would have already seen them. I got really scared and hid under the blankets and then eventually slept. But I still don&#39;t know what made that sound to this day.</p>

It was super sunny and around 11am, not many students about as they are all either asleep or at class. I turned the corner to my block and happened to look into a kitchen on the ground floor, I see a figure that struck me as odd. It was a woman or a girl or something, couldn&#39;t see her face so I couldn&#39;t tell. She was stood with her back turned in the unlit kitchen and had long black hair, kind of like the girl from the ring, but better kept. I slowed to a stop and did a sort of double take and stared at her for a few seconds, before realising she was stood completely still. I got a really weird feeling from it, she wasn&#39;t moving and inch... Just stood there. I was on the other side of the street and didn&#39;t know what to do.<br/>
Well, I thought, my apartment is right there so if I could quickly get my phone maybe I can take a picture. It was probably a weird student prank or something.<br/>
I did exactly that, rushed into my apartment, grabbed my phone and ran into the kitchen (opposite side, one floor up) to see that the figure was gone. I was kind of disappointed cus I love spooky stuff but shrugged it off as a prank and forgot about it.  </p>

<p>Not really that creepy, but a few months later I found out that the student village is a remodelled mental asylum (in England btw, the buildings are pretty old) that was closed in the 90&#39;s due to allegations of abuse to patients. That kinda freaked me out... I&#39;m not really superstitious but I think about it a lot.</p>

I didn’t dare move and I remember staring at it all. Night. Long. Until the light of dawn starting coming in and reveled a giant, stuffed, fluffy, alligator.

One night I was up late for a project i did. I wanna say it was about 2 AM when this takes place. Im alone at home due to my family being across the country for a few days. Keep in mind at this point I was already used to being alone. 
So I sat there and suddenly the light in the garden turns on, indicating something is there. Me, assuming the worst, still look out the window to see if i can catch anything. Low and behold there is a humanoid shape standing at the edge of the entrance and looking seemingly straight at me. Immediately im terrified and just pull out my phone and call the police while keeping my eyes locked on the guy. While im on the phone he starts moving towards the house and i immediately nope the fuck out of there. I run through the front door and scream &quot;Fire&quot; and just run to our neighbors.
Later when the cops show up they tell me  about it probably being the same burglar who robbed two families in my neighborhood. </p>

<p>Needless to say im always coming along on trips with my family nowadays. 
It does shake me up when i think back to the time i had a staring contest with a burglar tho.</p>

<p>There were a few interesting things that happened to me as a child that I can remember, and they were all centered around these two houses we lived in at the time, but I&#39;ll go with the most interesting one.</p>

<p>This one was in the house we went to after my grandmothers - and it&#39;s way more simple. This house had a lot of weird stuff happen in it, from my dad seeing a weird dark shape in the hallway, to waking up one morning and finding all of the cabinets open, but this was something that happened to me specifically. My dad&#39;s roommate, Joe, loved to mess with me - often at my own expense, he&#39;d pull pranks on me, pick fun at me, all that kind of stuff. So at one point I&#39;m in my room playing and I get up to go and get a drink, and I try to open the door.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t open the door, and it feels like someone is holding it shut with all of their might. I start pulling harder, and assuming it&#39;s Joe messing with me, but it&#39;s like a failing game of tug of war, and for a second I swear I see an arm holding the door shut when I was pulling. I pull for a solid minute before the door finally flies open with my weight and I&#39;m thrown back on the floor. Still thinking it was Joe messing with me, I get up and go through the house and find my mom int eh kitchen. I ask her where he is, and she tells me outside, I don&#39;t think about it too much and go outside to where my dad and Joe are, who are smoking, and I ask Joe why he was holding my door shut on me</p>

<p>Joe pauses and looks at my dad, and my dad looked immediately worried, because apparently Joe had been out on the patio with him for thirty minutes talking. I wondered if they were messing with me at first, but the fact that they both got up and started to take a look around the entire house told me that it was a bit more serious than them messing with me.</p>

<p>It also dawns on me in hindsight that with how the house was set up, he&#39;d have to have moved really quickly to get back outside because my door was the second furthest away from the sliding door that led out onto the patio, and I would have seen him heading that way by the time I got into the room with the exit out there. And once all this kind of clicked in my head, this memory went and cemented itself in my mind because I can&#39;t explain it at all, and I don&#39;t know why it lingers in the back of my mind so much, but it does.</p>

<p>I live about 35 minutes away from my college building so I was walking home one night, I had to stay late to get some work done and the shuttles weren’t running at the time. But I didn’t mind a walk.
I had my headphones on and listening to some random music I went, though there was a moment where nothing was playing as I searched for a specific song. And then I could hear the chorus of a bunch of croaking frogs in the distance, which I haven’t heard in a long time so I took my headphones off to listen to them. But then at one point once I crossed a street they just suddenly stopped.
It was dead silent, no cars, no wind, no frogs. It felt like I was in an underground tunnel because it was so silent. It weirded me out but I figured “oh something just spooked the frogs and they’re done for tonight”, but that wasn’t the only weird thing I dealt with that night.
The entire time I was walking I saw maybe only two cars go past me, there’s not a lot of activity on the streets at that hour, not a lot of other walkers as well. I had my headphones on again but I had really quiet music playing and as I was waiting for the walk signal I hear someone walking up behind me and stop right around where I was. At first I didn’t think much of it, could have been another person just wanting time cross the street so I turned to see (just in case I was going to get mugged) but there wasn’t anyone there. Of course that freaked me out a bit because I’m a paranoid person so I just turned back to the crosswalk with a dead stomach. 
And for almost the rest of the walk I kept feeling like someone else was there, but then again that could have just been my paranoia.</p>

So basically I thought I saw a vampire and I was obsessed with mythical creatures so after I thought I saw him, I had a dream about vampires. Then over summer I would  occasionaly look at the window at the tree behind my house. One day when fall was approaching, I went out and stood in front of the trees. I looked up and said &quot;you know fall is approaching and the leaves will fall off the trees and people will see you. If you want you can sleep in the big shed. Or you can knock on my window and I will open it.&quot; And then I left and went back inside. Later the next few days fall was finally there and one day I woke up with a bruise, so I decided that that night I would record audio to see if I could hear anything. So I set up my tablet that night and fell asleep. The next morning I went through the audio and I heard something about 2 hours in. It was like three or two heavy breaths and then three loud knocks that came from my window. I was petrified. And then I told some of my friends about it and they said they started to see stuff once they left my house. One day on my birthday, I was having a sleep over. And me and my friend J were in a different room because she needs to be able to watch something before bed. Well once she fell asleep I turned off my tablet and got ready for bed. There were other friends there too but they were sleeping in my room. So about 5 min of silence my friend K burst through the door bawling her eyes out. I turned to her and asked what was wrong and she continued to scream saying she saw the &quot;vampire&quot; and she was terrified. She ended up sleeping with me and J to calm her. To this day I still don&#39;t know what it was. My mom said her friend saw Miner ghost one time, which is crazy because there used to be a mine shaft behind my house. But I really don&#39;t know what to believe.</p>

So i&#39;m 17 years old in Sixth Form (the last two years of high school in the UK) and i&#39;m staying at my grandams house. Now my grandmas house has always been creepy anyways as i  always here my name being called and footsteps or creaking when i know i&#39;m the only one inside, but i have to live there because its close to my sixth form and i always assumed i was imaging things because of stress. Now one night i go to sleep in my grandmas guest room, which has two beds. I sleep in the one furthest from the door and the side of the bed faces the door. I wake up in the middle of the night for absolutely no reason and i can see a sort of shadow in the figure of my grandmother standing in the doorway. I squint a little and say &#39;yo nanny, whats up?&#39; and my grandma starts creeping slowly towards me. about a second into the movement i realize that my grandma is walking forwards without moving her arms or legs and that the door itself has been closed the entire time. Now me being incredibly depressed about life in general and knowing that im probably about to be attacked by a demon, decided to roll over in my bed, sigh and then quietly say to myself, &#39;fuck my life&#39;. I fell asleep again pretty quickly and in the morning i woke up to my door being open and my lights on. I asked my grandma if she went into my room that night and she said no. Later on my cousin began to stay with me at my grandmothers for a couple of months too, he stayed in the guest room with me and said that i would speak in gibberish or a Latin-esque language in my dreams and that some days when he as alone he could hear guests downstairs playing music on my grandmas record player. we kept living there for a few months each but were both 100% convinced that the house was haunted or my grandma was part of a cult.</p>

<p>The first is a few months after i move into my new house. I woke up one morning because I felt the corner of my bed frame being kicked repeatedly. My bed has a metal frame and fairy lights around the headboard so everything i heard and felt was definitely real. But nobody was in my room, and from what I could feel from my bed being kicked, it was coming from the bottom right corner right up against the wall and being kicked diagonally. Which is impossible?? None of it makes ant sense and i still haven&#39;t been able to think of a logical explanation to what happened. I know it&#39;s minor but its still hella brain fucky. </p>

<p>Another time,
 I wake up half asleep to reposition myself in bed when i feel something grabbing my hair and following me as i sat up. I&#39;m frantically trying to grab whatever is trying to grab me and i finally catch it. Turns out I had fallen asleep on my arm and it&#39;d gone completely numb under my head. Stupidest shit ive ever shat myself over.</p>

Once I had realized that I had become induced in to this fear filled sleep paralyzation. I couldn’t move, all I could do is breath, blink, and think. It felt like an eternity of staring my demon in the face, his grin glistening with blood and brain matter, when I noticed something in the background. “ now I have lived in my current house for 3 plus years now and know the layout like the back of my hand.” “So you have to understand how fucking horrified I was when the same demon on the screen of my phone looking into the windows of my soul, was also standing outside a door peeking inside, waiting for me to blink.” I WAS PETRIFIED, I know this sounds kinda lame but you have to understand that I said I knew the layout of my house like that back of my hand, The door that the demon was standing behind wasn’t there when I laid down that night, THE DOOR NEVER FUCKING EXISTED. I was scared shitless. After a while I just closed my eyes and expected to have my organs ripped out and my brain splattered on the wall, but that never happened, we just stared at each other until the sun came up the next morning, as the beams broke through my curtains, the demons disintegrated and I was free...</p>

<p>Some sort of creature seemed to be stalking me through the house and at a point in time I wake up the moment I realize said creature is lying directly next to me behind me on the other side of my bed. I cannot move and my hands are crossed under a blanket pulled up to my chin. I struggle to turn my head to look at it and try to open my mouth to call for help but it&#39;s like I cannot speak, I struggle so much I am shaking, I can still look around with my eyes and I see my own room with an open door with some light coming through it. Next thing I know I feel fingertips that are cold and seemingly sharper than the usual human slowly starting to push into my back, I am trying to make a sound as the lack of ability to move or speak makes it feel all the more painful. It keeps digging in to a point where it feels like it has penetrated my skin and I struggle even more to move yet all I am doing is shaking furiously in immense pain. You know that feeling where you&#39;re really trying to breathe or say something and you try so hard it makes you shake? That&#39;s kind of how it felt but so much worse. I closed my eyes for a few hoping it would go away and I open them back up, I am in the same room and I am able to move again.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember very much about the nightmare before and never saw the creature which I&#39;m thankful for but also curious what it did look like. My first and only night terror, I do not wish anyone the experience because it felt like it lasted a long time and was very painful.</p>

<p>There is however a real experience when I was younger than 10 probably, we lived in a different house at the time. I was at home, we had a basement and an attic. Our cats are all outdoors except for one who is sleeping where I can see them and everyone but my mother is away, my mother is downstairs doing some laundry and she had asked me to light some candles and I was in the process of doing it. All windows and doors are all locked so there was no draft. Eventually as I am right next to the entrance of the attic lighting candles there I hear a sudden thud as if a heavy box had come falling down in the attic and right after I could hear heavy footprints run right across where I was standing from where the box fell and it stopped, directly after the candle I had just lit was blown out. I was terrified and ran down to my mother and told her about it.</p>

<p>We have never had rodent problems nor is there any way for an animal to get up there, it was a very scary experience and I have no idea what it was and we can&#39;t explain it.</p>

<p>So, my family and I are pretty firm believers in paranormal stuff. 
My dad&#39;s sister had a house where drawers would open and close, etc. My dad&#39;s mother had a house where, when they were growing up, they remember seeing a couple of figures walking around and opening/closing doors. My dad was the youngest out of 7 and they all remember seeing these figures.</p>

<p>When my parents got their first house (where my brother and I grew up). They actually did a cleansing on the house. They had two cats at the time and neither one would go in the room upstairs that was across from theirs. It was the room they had planned to make into my brother&#39;s nursery/room when he was born. The cats would hiss and growl at the doorway. After the cleansing, the cats were perfectly fine going in and out of the room. 
However, the weird shit never stopped.</p>

<p>As we got older, weird things happened around the house. At night, downstairs (where my room was) it always felt like someone was watching you; just staring. 
My brother told me something later on when we were older that scared the crap out of me. He said that every night at around 10 pm. This figure would walk into his room and stare at him. He would always wake up too if he wasn&#39;t already up. However, the figure looked just like dad. When he blinked, the figure just disappeared. He even asked &#39;dad&#39; why he was in the room, but it would just stay silent and disappear when he blinked. He said he eventually realized it wasn&#39;t dad because when he saw it one night he heard dad coughing in his room. I looked up if people have ever seen figures that looked like a friend or relative who was still alive and it has happened to other people. </p>

<p>The scariest thing I ever experienced happened to me and my brother in his room (the one the cats wouldn&#39;t go into at first). I hated his room honestly. When you walked in, right across the doorway was the door to the attic that was locked up. His closet was on the wall to the left of the attic door and had a sloped ceiling. His room just gave off bad vibes. I think the closet was the coolest part of his room because it was pretty big and we made it into a clubhouse. I often played with my brother up in his room because he would want to play cars on his rug that was made to look like a city with roads on it. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t remember where my dad was at the time (mom was gone, they separated so she lived somewhere else), but he wasn&#39;t home and I was at the age where I could look after my brother for a couple of hours. We were playing upstairs in his room and his closet door was closed. Suddenly, we heard something in his closet. Like something had fallen or gotten bumped into. I went to open the closet door to see what made the noise; thinking that maybe a toy had fallen over because it was a mess. Plus, my brother got spooked by the noise and wouldn&#39;t calm down until I checked it out.</p>

<p>Right when I got up to the door I heard a loud growling noise come from the closet. My brother and I screamed and we raced downstairs. We debated staying downstairs until dad got home, but we were both nervous and stressed out at the point. We couldn&#39;t stand just sitting downstairs and waiting to see what would happen. Thankfully, the house was a mess downstairs with our toys and so we found something that would work as a shield and a couple of &#39;weapons&#39; (a fake sword and a plastic baseball bat). I guess as kids, we thought we would be good against whatever made that terrible growling noise if we had a plastic shield and plastic weapons. Plus, the light of day gave us strength because monsters weren&#39;t even supposed to be out during the day (kid logic). </p>

<p>We climbed quietly up the stairs and peered into his room. Nothing. We tiptoed over to his closet, holding the shield up, and looked at it. The closet door was now opened slightly and the door was missing a chunk of wood out of the middle of it. Not the side of the door, but right in the middle.  Now, it was a hollow door, but still. It scared us to death. I found a heavy enough toy to throw by the door to see what would happen. However, we didn&#39;t hear a thing and when we got brave enough to look inside the closet there was nothing there but the toys. Nothing was taken or destroyed inside the closet, just the door. Needless to say, we took our toys and stayed downstairs until my dad got home. We tried to explain what happened, but my dad was convinced that we had done it while playing. Maybe, he didn&#39;t want to think of the possibility of it being something else.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, my brother was able to sleep in his room that night. I think his younger age at the time made it easy for him to forget and put off to the side. However, I never forgot and it took a while for me to be comfortable playing upstairs with him; especially if we were home alone. Nothing that bad ever happened again besides my brother&#39;s visitor. I have no clue if the two could be connected. We moved out a few years later and I do miss the house because it was my childhood home. 
I will say, the paranormal seem to flock to my brother. He had a few experiences at my aunt&#39;s house after that, but thankfully at the house we moved to he never mentioned anything spooky happening. </p>

<p>TDLR: My brother sees creatures/dead people and we had a demon(?) in his closet that left a hole in the closet door.</p>

<p>Story #1:</p>

<p>This was a couple years ago. I was chilling in my room staying up far too late on a school night. As I was watching YouTube videos I saw my door start to close in my peripheral vision. Now just to let you know my door when open is in front of half of my closet and the corner of my room. I was very scared as my door slowly closed, it looked as if someone or something was either in my closet or in the corner and was pushing the door away. My situation got even worse when my brother, who was across the hall, started garbling random stuff while he was asleep. Now it’s not uncommon for him to sleep talk but it occurred while my door was closing and he was especially loud. I remember that I yelled out that he needed to stop messing with me because I wanted to rationalize the situation where somehow he was playing a prank. He wasn’t he was asleep. My door closed late at night for about 5 days but my brother didn’t sleep talk after the first night. Eventually I got used to it somehow then it stopped. </p>

<p>Story #2:</p>

<p>Now this one is just absolutely terrifying. Now my family has a history of problems with sleeping that include sleep paralysis, parasomnia, insomnia, etc. Now I’ve had sleep paralysis which was scary but it’s incomparable to this. I’m just going to insert what I wrote in my dream journal just as I woke up: </p>

<p>In my dream/nightmare I was aware of my dream but I unusually cannot control it like I would with a lucid dream. Because of how strange it gets and how badly I want to escape I try to wake up or control the dream. At times I can control it, for example I made (insert favorite band here) appear and they were extremely realistic. I remember that I was on the porch and I saw a red moon have an eclipse. The band members came to the porch, I wanted to talk to them but they didn’t seem to notice me at all. I tried to control my dream but it had a life out it’s own. I was aware of my dream and knew no one in my dream was real. I tried to wake up and I would wake up... in my dream. I would “wake up” in a different place thinking I escaped my horrendous dream but I didn’t. I was even in a car with (my brother) who was explaining something about how the fabric of reality was broke. I finally relaxed and believed that I was finally in reality. But then (my favorite band) showed up in the back seat, (my brother) smiled disturbingly. His flesh seemed to melt and his smile seemed to cut into his skin and he drove into a brick wall, and by drove into I mean he drove inside of a brike wall. I writing this at 2:52 pre Halloween day and I am truly scared. In my dream even my grandpa (I live with my grandparents) was telling me to go to bed because I “woke up” in the middle of the night. I told him my terrible situation, falling asleep, things that weren’t real “becoming real” i thought I had gone insane. Once I finally woke up I really was unsure if I was in real life. I still don’t. What establishments something to be “real”? I’m not sure but this experience definitely made untrusting of reality.</p>

<p>Story #3: </p>

<p>Short story time that actually has reasons for it to be completely normal and not scary at all. I woke up when I was like 7 and wanted to get a drink of water. I got out of my bed but I stopped once I entered the hall. There was a plant in the hall and one of my baby dolls was sitting on the edge of the potter. I ran back to bed and went back to sleep. This really scared me because I could’ve swore that the doll was in my room when I want to sleep and the way it was “sitting” was so strangely human. Also another night I woke up along with my mom (I lived with her at the time) and the sink faucet turned on by itself.</p>

It starts with a slowly creeping onset of sleep paralysis. I can slowly feel myself lose the ability to open my eyes or move, but I’m 100% aware of everything around me (sounds and such). It starts with slight hallucinations, like I could see my laptop screen even though I had closed it before I went to bed. This happens for what feels like 5 minutes, just various hallucinations of actions I was doing right before going to bed. A pressure begins to build up on my sides, it feels like a weird mixture of someone grabbing my sides and pins and needles setting in. Then it seems as if I wake up. More often than not, I’ll “wake up” in the dream on my bed, so I have no reason to believe I’m still asleep. But it’s always a semi-lucid dream. I can control myself and what I do, but I can’t control anything around me. I’ve found that in these dreams, everything seems normal until I turn my phone on and open snapchat. The app bugs out, and then it fades to black. The dream always ends right after I see the app breaking. On nights where I forget to check my phone, it continues as normal before “reality collapses” and everything starts to lose it sense of realism. Walls move, furniture disappears, and other similar stuff. This usually happens for what feels like 30 minutes, with the dreams slowly becoming more and more scary. They slowly start to have “less light”, and the area around me progressively gets darker. Like in the first dream it’ll be noon, and then 4:00 in the second, and by the last one it’s pitch black, and it’s always the EXACT same. My phones always gone, so I can’t end this dream early by using the little cheat code I found. I can still control myself and walk around my house which almost looks 100% accurate except for a few minor details. This dream is always the most realistic, which makes it the most terrifying. I hear people talking, and I don’t recognize the voices. I hear things moving around me, and it slowly but surely keeps getting darker throughout the dream. I start seeing shapes which start to take form into creatures unlike any I’ve ever seen before. They start chasing me, and I slowly start moving slower and slower. By the time I can’t move anymore, my vision goes 100% black, and they’re always maybe 3 feet away from me. I’ve started going to therapy for this, because something clearly isn’t right. It happens maybe 1-2 times a week, and it’s been going on for almost 2 months.</p>

<p>I remember in the dream I was walking in a weird, surreal world floating in the clouds. I went into a strange rock house and there were my grandmas sitting at a stone table. I walked out of the house and started walking through a city. At some point I realised I am in a dream. It was a very weird feeling. I started screaming for someone to wake my up, but no one listened. And suddenly a creepy old lady turned to me and said that she can help me wake up. She said that it will only cost my BLOOD. Her eyes turned red, and she showed her vampire teeth, and then she jumped at me and I woke up. It was one of the strangest dreams I&#39;ve ever had</p>

I was probably around 13-14 at the time, and I had always hated scary movies because my overactive imagination causes me to see/hear things all the time. Anyway, I was trying to fall asleep and I made the stupid mistake of opening my eyes and looking out of my window. My heart froze when I saw a dark silhouette with glowing eyes staring at me through my window. I froze, and my heart started beating very fast. The terror started to set in, but I had to know what it was that was staring at me. I rubbed my eyes to get them adjusted, and when I looked out again, I noticed that it was the neighbor&#39;s cat. The sigh of relief that left me at that time was real. Eventually, the cat left, and I managed to fall asleep.</p>

I woke up around midnight hearing a beep, almost like am alarm. I had just gotten my first phone a few months prior ( a track phone that was like 4in by 2in). I used the alarm feature to wake me up for school so I thought it must have been the phone. I checked to see that it was dead, put it on the charger and went back to bed. Over the next 3 hours I kept hearing beeps and noises from what I assumed to be a phone. The sound came from the area near my window, that was maybe 6 feet above ground level and looked out to the back yard. I was terrified, ever buzz or vibration made me more scared to move. I cried silently till I fell back asleep. But every noise or movement I made, even after getting up and turning a light on, made the noises stop for maybe 10min before I heard another.  I still sleep in that room,now almost 18yo, but I have black out curtains.</p>

It started giving off a high pitch beep. </p>

<p>Creeped out I took a step back and the screen changed again to blue. Another step and it changed again back to the rainbow screen. Absolutely freaked out I grabbed my dog and booked it out of the house and went to my neighbors. </p>

<p>Now my neighbors living room has a large window that looks into the same large window we have in our living room. So we can see into each others house&#39;s if we wanted to.</p>

<p>My neighbors kids were home but their parents were also working. But they let me in after I told them what happened. We all headed into the living room to look into the tv room of my house.</p>

<p>Except the curtains were closed. Then they moved. Then we all saw a face looking back at us. We screamed like hell and stopped looking at my house. Still can&#39;t explain it to this day and my mom was exasperated with us when she had to come get me from the neighbors. </p>

<p>The previous owner of the house passed away here, in my bedroom. All of the animals refuse to go in there. And sometimes I hear scratching on the walls and from the ceiling at night. But probably a squirrel, right?</p>

<p>I used to code games on a website called Scratch. My games were all usually crappy and would take a long time to make, since I didn&#39;t really understand coding. Anyway, I was making a game called <em>The Pixie Games.</em> It was one of those games where the deeper you go, the darker the game becomes. While I was testing the game, the game paused. It turned black, and in the middle of the screen were two red eyes, a wide red smile, and red horns. The image wouldn&#39;t remove itself, and for a while, the game became just that. A black screen with a red smile. Eventually I found out that one of the sprites was lingering on the screen for to long. I scrapped the game due to several failures, but released it to the public. That glitch had to be the creepiest thing that happened to me.</p>

<p>So this happened about 4 years ago in Williamsburg, specifically the historic part (if you’ve never been there’s basically a section of Williamsburg that is a throwback to what it would’ve looked like back in the olden days with actors and whatnot) and walking through it during the day is a fun time, but it hits different at night </p>

<p>Why was I in historic Williamsburg at night? For a ghost tour of course. My parents and I have always been interested in the supernatural and paranormal, my mom specifically as she’s a Sensitive and grew up seeing ghosts and whatnot. We got to go to an extended late night ghost tour, which didn’t end until 1am in the old historic town. Our tour guide told us that while we weren’t technically allowed in the town at night they wouldn’t tell on us if we did stay, and if we ran into a police officer we were not to mention their name. So stay we did. </p>

<p>My mom went around to each site our tour guide showed us earlier and was taking pictures with her camera while my dad and I were fucking around. </p>

<p>Now weird things kept happening to my mom during the hour or two we stayed behind. Things like her flash not working even when it was on, her camera mysteriously dying even though she had just put in fresh batteries, stereotypical spooky stuff. She ignored it though, so my dad and I did as well. All in all it was a fun time, but I eventually started getting freaked out and was like “hey can we maybe leave”. By the time we left it was around 3am. </p>

<p>As we’re leaving the town my mom is trailing ahead of us, still taking the occasional picture, while my dad and I are trailing behind, still cracking jokes and fucking around. As we’re joking my mom stops a couple feet ahead of us, just stops dead in her tracks in the middle of the road. My dad and I are like “hey why’d you stop?” And she just shushes us and goes “do you hear that?” We did not, so we walked closer and stopped, just listening. </p>

<p>That’s when we heard it. Coming from an alleyway in between two of the buildings was music. Not just any music though, it was colonial march music. Like the stereotypical music that you’d hear in movies when troops were walking into battle, with the drums and flutes and stuff. </p>

<p>We all stare at each other, each with varying levels of horror on our faces. I say “I think it’s coming from that alleyway”, and suddenly it stops. We’re just standing there in complete silence for about a minute, trying to figure out what just happened. Finally I say “well I think it’s time to go” and start walking towards the entrance. </p>

<p>Now mind you, we’d all been to Williamsburg during the day, and we spent a good portion of our day in the town. Not once did any of us hear that specific song/music anywhere in the town. </p>

<p>Also as we were leaving we all saw a silhouette in the window of a house that the tour guide said was basically abandoned. Apparently someone owned the house, it was the only building in the town that didn’t belong to the town, but that no one was ever seen entering or exiting the house. So that was cool.</p>

He said he could hear me calling him from upstairs, which was impossible because he would&#39;ve seen me.

I was just getting in to bed when I noticed a strange shadow of a mans head on my wall. I don&#39;t know why I thought it was off; I just didn&#39;t want to see it, so I called in my parents. They saw the shadow and proceeded to take down a lot of dolls and figures I had on my shelf to get rid of it. 5 minutes passed and all the toys were moved to the floor. The shadow was still there. My parents expiremented with their own shadows and the shadow head to try and see what made it. After 2 minutes of this my mother told me to stay in my brother&#39;s old room and she would sleep there instead. By this point I realized that the shadow wanted to stay and I didn&#39;t mind sleeping in that room. (I still don&#39;t know why I felt like that to this day.) However, my mother insisted and when I woke up the next day I went to check on her. </p>

<p>Her account: When I woke up I couldn&#39;t breathe properly. There was a weight on my chest that didn&#39;t leave for a while and I couldn&#39;t open my eyes. When it did leave, I was able to open my eyes and catch a glimpse of a dark figure leaving the room out the open door.</p>

<p>My first thought when I heard that at age 8 or 9 was, &quot;I should have stayed in that room. Mom wouldn&#39;t have been scared if I stayed.&quot; I had no reason to believe that and in fact I should have been glad to not have possibly experienced that. But even to this day when I think back to that night, I feel a guilt and regret of an opportunity I missed. I can not explain why I feel that way now or felt that way then. It is creepy to others, but not to me.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my only expereince that I still can not find a logical explanation for.</p>

I was confused and kept my eyes closed, trying to go back to sleep when I felt something. It felt like someone&#39;s hands were crawling up my shirt, very slowly. I considered what it might have been. An attacker? Sleep paralysis?  Suddenly the feeling stopped right below my chest. Then it quickly rushed up as if about to grab my throat. I finally decided to open my eyes and the feeling was gone. I&#39;m wide awake now. I check under the bed, in my closet, anywhere that a person could hide. Nothing. At this point I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep so I just started getting ready for school cause what else was I going to do?</p>

<p>To add context, my family sleepover at my grandparents house so we can socialize with my cousins and the rest of the family. After young children have gone to bed, the adults tend to do a ouija board/seance regularly as some members are incredibly superstitious, whilst others are not. An example of someone who did not believe was my grandad, until this event. </p>

<p>When I was three and not particularly articulate, I came downstairs later in the evening while the adults were doing a seance. As soon as I came in I didn&#39;t say anything but only walked up to my grandfather and said &quot;You could&#39;ve stopped me Thomas&quot; then proceeded to vomit on the floor. What was odd about this statement was the fact they had just been &quot;contacting&quot; my grandad&#39;s father in the seance, who committed suicide in front of my grandad. Of course a three year old would not know this information and therefore makes a weird coincidence. </p>

<p>After this event, my mother noticed I had heterochromia in my left eye (two different colours in my iris which was 2/3 blue and 1/3 brown). The only other person to have heterochromia, and this exact pattern was my great grandfather. </p>

<p>I of course do not remember these events but from then on, all of my family who witnessed the event are incredibly superstitious and no longer have seances anymore.</p>

<p>I must’ve been in middle school at the time. It was a summer night, I was getting ready to go to sleep. I slept in a single bunk bed, bottom half being space for a desk. Once I was finished taking a cold shower (due to the heat of the weather at the time), I dove right to sleep. There were no fans, the air conditioning was at a warm 86 degrees, and I had no water. Keep that in mind. When I went to sleep, I began to go through a sleep terror. My eyes were open, I could see around my room, but I couldn’t move. Then, my door slowly creaked open, revealing an empty and dark hallway. However, there was someone in my doorway, they were wearing a dark cloak. Coupling that with the dark room, and it was impossible to identify who it could be. The being entered my room, but seemed to move so still, that their head was stationary, no bobbing. The figure turned its head in my direction, and all I could see, was darkness. It was like a void was looking back at me. Then, the figure raised its arm. The only part revealed, was its hand. It was all bones, no meat or skin at all. That was when I connected the dots and realized who it was. It was the grim reaper, death itself. They reached out to grab my hand, as it was hanging off the bed. The closer their hand got, the more I heard the sounds of children playing and sirens blaring, getting louder and louder. Then, just before they made it, the hand jerked forward and gripped my hand harder than anybody has before. It was cold, and very unsettling. I was terrified. Then, like a falling dream, I jolted awake. Death was gone, and I could move again. This would be an average case of sleep paralysis, except, that wasn’t the scariest part. After waking up, my hand was frozen. It was numb, I couldn’t feel a thing with it. It was as cold as ice. That hand, was the same one grabbed by death itself. Remember, it was summer, I live in Nevada, there weren’t any fans, and the room temperature was 86 degrees. There was absolutely no reason my hand would be cold in that moment. I couldn’t go back to sleep, especially not after that. So, being the terrified child I was, I stayed up for the rest of the night. I terrified that he would return to finish the job.</p>

My friends and I were driving around my small hometown in Kansas late one night on a weekend. It was about three in the morning and I had dropped off everyone at their homes and started to head back home myself. I was driving down one of the main roads in the town and I was kind of dazing off a little, but I knew I could make it back to my house because it was only a few blocks away. I blinked, and the next thing I saw was a small kid on his tricycle in the middle of the road. I slammed on my breaks and I felt my car jerk and bounce, instantly knowing I had just ran over this poor kid in the middle of the road. I could hear his screams of terror and agony as my car stalled and died in the middle of the street. I got out panicked from just running someone over, however, there was no sign of life in the street other than myself. I looked up the street and under my car but there was no sign of the child or the tricycle. The front of my car was undamaged but my heart was in my throat. I quickly started my car and drove home. I laid in bed for a little while before I managed to drift off to sleep from exhaustion. It didn&#39;t last long however, for I woke up to a child screaming bloody murder. I laid in bed awake for the rest of the night and watched the shadows play tricks on my eyes. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>After that night, the screaming child disappeared and I never drove on that road again after 10 pm.</p>

<p>Ever since I was really little I’ve been prone to waking up in the middle of the night. I still do to this day, and it’s usually around 3:00 AM. I’ve never thought anything of it. I don’t even open my eyes most of the time since it’s just a normal part of my life. I’ve always figured it was something my body has always done. 1 specific experience, however, makes me wonder if it’s something more than some sort of bodily timer.</p>

<p>When I was around 11-12, I woke up in the middle of the night like usual. I sighed at the inconvenience, rolled over, and tried to go back to sleep. But instead of drifting off like usual, I was suddenly overcome with this anxious feeling. The feeling you get when you feel like your being watched or followed. I didn’t want to open my eyes, both out of fear and because I wanted to get back to sleep, but I got so unnerved by this feeling that I decided to take a quick peak, just to calm myself down. </p>

<p>I shouldn’t have. </p>

<p>I wasn’t greeted with the almost pitch black of my room. I wasn’t greeted by one of my parents checking on me. I wasn’t greeted by my dog, who usually slept at the end of my bed. Instead, I was greeted to my wide open door, and a pitch black figure starring straight at me. </p>

<p>It wasn’t one of my parents. It wasn’t one of my grandparents. I don’t even think it was human. It was like light couldn’t touch it. Even the bathroom safety light seemed to not be able to light any part of it. It was just pitch black. Like I was starring at a black hole shaped like a human. </p>

<p>I starred at it for a good 10 seconds. Then I blinked. And it was gone. </p>

<p>There are a million different explanations that I’ve come up with for this. It could’ve just been my brain playing a trick in me, since I had just woken up. Maybe it really was just one of my parents checking on me, and my sleepy brain perceived it as something completely different. Maybe it was a dream. But the one thing that makes me think twice when it comes to any logical explanation is the fact that my door was still open after it happened. My parents would always close the door after checking on me. That door stayed open the entire night. I don’t know what it could’ve been, but whatever or whoever it was, it scared the shit out of me. And now, whenever I wake up in the middle of the night, I get the same anxious feeling.</p>

<p>One night maybe 2-3 years ago,  I was heading to bed and it was around maybe 12am. At this point I was so very tired and paranoia and the night-terrors started to kick in. I was heading upstairs and I turned off the basement light as I was going up I became more paranoid. I get to the platform between the stairs and I stop and look out the window, Start I hearing a faint but heavy clopping. It had sped up and something rushes by the window, what I managed to see of the was huge, around 7-9ft tall had huge antlers and a partly skulled face. The clopping faded, I eventually processed what happened.  I knew it was a Wendigo and I knew it wasn&#39;t real but I was completely taken aback to what I just saw, this was the first time I heard it and saw it in such detail. Most times its just shadows and me poorly imagining the sounds. I then continued to bed because this happens to much. </p>

<p>As a bit of context, I have something that my family calls night-terrors, if you look this up its not going to be the same. This happens when i&#39;m awake but very tired, and yes its common but it runs quite heavily in my family. Mix this with paranoia and its worse. I hear and see things in great detail I could draw what I saw.</p>

The way my apartment was set up allowed me to see about 25% of the kitchen the rest being blocked by a wall and the kitchen and living room being connected by an island. Well one night i randomly woke up and couldnt move. All i could do was look around. I notice something standing in the kitchen but because if the wall all I could see was it arm. It held its arm in a 90° angle then begin to wave but only moving its arm at the joint of it elbow. It waved about three times until it slowly dropped its arm and was completely out of view. After a few minutes of me just staring to make sure my mind wasnt just making figures out of the dark the thing started walking out of the kitchen. It was about 5&#39;6 and had mangy black hair. It slowly walked around the island until it was standing at the foot of the living room. Then it got on all fours and started crawling towards me. This was especially terrifying because i had a pillow on my chest blocking my view of the floor. After a couple seconds i start to feel the weight of its limbs on my body. It arm slowing reaching up until I can see its fingers grow past the pillow. Its skin was grey but its fingers were pitch black. It slowly gripped the pillow but before it could rip it from me I woke up. I could move. It was still the middle of the night though and i was still terrified.
I had seen the thing in previous dreams where i couldnt move but it had never been that close. I havent seen it again so i kinda feel like in that incident it was telling me goodbye. </p>

<p>My friends seem to think that i was dealing with sleep paralysis but i refuse to believe this. It&#39;d make things too scary for me.</p>

<p>I was in my mid to late teens I think, I had slept really late for some reason so the sun was out when I woke up. I felt like I was strapped to the bed, and my body was literally unable to move. So I started panicking, obviously. I couldn&#39;t speak either, it felt like I was choked up the whole time. Eventually I see some sort of shadow on my wall, and it starts moving around. So I&#39;m freaking out more. It goes from the wall to the floor, and finally it&#39;s on my bed, staring at me. I can&#39;t move so I&#39;m just staring at it, struggling with everything I have to move. (At this point, I understand that it&#39;s sleep paralysis but I&#39;m still freaking out.) After it moves towards me, my legs kick up in the air and I land on my bed, sweating, heart racing, etc. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not scary when you say &quot;I had sleep paralysis once&quot; but experiencing it, man. It&#39;s a whole new ball game.</p>

When I was 13 me and my family were getting ready to move, so we constantly had people coming to our house for renovations, painting, etc. When I was home alone someone rang the door bell, but I wasn&#39;t supposed to get the door when I was home alone. We lived in a small neighborhood, so we kept the door unlocked most of the time. I quickly regretted this when a man opened the front door, walked in and looked me straight in the eyes. &quot;I&#39;m here for the radon,&quot; he said &quot;I need to put these in the basement.&quot; I was absolutely terrified at this point, but I didn&#39;t want to slow down the moving process and I didn&#39;t think to call my dad. I was incredibly stupid and showed him to the basement. Later that day my dad came home and when I told him about the man he was shocked, &quot;no one was supposed to come today,&quot; &quot;what did you tell him?&quot; I was definitely not going to admit I let him in the basement so I lied. I told him I asked the man to leave. &quot;good, that was a bad man. That explains the police car out front.&quot;(I&#39;m still not really sure why there was a police car in front of our house, but sure enough there was) After that, I went into our basement and found 2 strange devices the man must have left. My silly 13 year old brain was convinced they were bombs, soooo... I chucked them in the forest behind my house. Turns out he really was just a radon guy who came on the wrong day and I had to go find the equipment I had previously chucked with all my strength(which isn&#39;t much cuz I&#39;m weak af) and return them to the basement. I continued to lie and told my parents that he simply told me to put them in the basement instead of me actually letting him down. Looking back, I am very grateful I didn&#39;t think to call my dad because if I did I might&#39;ve actually stabbed this guy thinking he was a robber or something. I had nightmares for weeks.</p>

<p>That night, I got up out of bed to blow my nose and my roommate sat bolt up and said “what are you doing?” I told her I was just blowing my nose and her response was “not you. The other girl”. I looked out our window and didn’t see anyone out in the street, and there wasn’t anyone making noise in the hall. I turned to her, terrified, and said “there is no other girl.” She looked me dead in the eyes with absolutely no expression, her voice suddenly much deeper, and said “there is always another girl”.</p>

<p>She remembers none of this.</p>

Even as a kid, I couldn&#39;t go anywhere without getting looks and having creepy men come up and talk to me. I&#39;ve had the whole &quot;Stranger Danger&quot; lecture more times than I can count, so I was always very cautious. However this happened more recently. So I was walking my girlfriend to the bus stop from my house, when I noticed this vaguely familiar red SUV with a loud engine driving rather slow and watching us. Now, the road we were on was always busy as it passes through a vast majority of our city, and the way this guy was driving was unnecessarily dangerous. He eventually picks up the pace after half a bazillion people honk at him.</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I get to the bus stop and she gets on, so I&#39;m left to walk back alone. I have social anxiety, so I decided to go a less crowded route. I figured the guy had been looking at her, as I thought she was prettier than me and didn&#39;t really think twice about my decision. Big mistake. So I head down the street to the more residential area, away from the busy street. A second after I turn a corner, I hear the same loud engine come down the road after me. I bring out my phone, pretending to check it, and use the screen to see if it really was him or not. It was. At this point I would have started running, but it was 102° F and the humidity was messing with my asthma. So I just stay calm, and try to think. The guy, who had been following a few feet behind me on the opposite side starts to come closer and trying to talk to me. By now, I was less than a block away from my apartment, so I said fuck it and started to sprint. The guy was picking up speed. I started hearing another voice coming from the truck. I could hear them tell the driver to pick up the pace, to &quot;hurry up and get her,&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t let her get away.&quot; I nearly start crying, but then I hear the engine start to have issues. Loud groaning noises are coming from the car, and they slow down enough for me to get to my door. I tell my parents and they look out the window. They&#39;re gone, but this story is not over.</p>

<p>That night my dog, a 9-month-old German Shepherd named Justice, suddenly decides she needs out at three in the morning. My family&#39;s little duplex apartment has no yard, so I have to take her around the block. Halfway through our walk, I see the SUV turn around the corner ahead of me and pull in to a neighbor&#39;s house. I recognize the men. They&#39;re my neighbor&#39;s buddies that always hang around his house and drink at all hours of the night. They, from what my neighbor and I had talked about, weren&#39;t quite right in the head and had been to jail. He had taken pity on them and had been trying to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; them. He was a nice guy and I didn&#39;t think he would hang around anyone that were inherently bad people, so I never bothered to ask what they went to jail for. Now I wish I had.</p>

I live in southern TN, Hamilton County. And about a month ago, there&#39;s been an influx of horrific weather. I was up playing on my Switch and it was raining a bit, but there was some precipitation in the forecast anyway, so I paid it no mind.</p>

<p>But as I kept playing, the wind, rain, and lightning kept getting worse. Eventually, our TV played the &#39;Weather Emergency&quot; alarm. When I walked into the living room, I saw &quot;TORNADO WARNING&quot;, and one of the counties mentioned was ours. Not even 10 minutes later, I look out my window and all I see is this fucking HUGE spiral of wind and debris passing by our neighborhood, followed by flying branches, small trees, one wooden plank actually broke off the side of our house before leaving orbit.</p>

<p>I was frozen in fear for a good 5 seconds before grabbing my dogs and gunning it downstairs. Thankfully, everyone&#39;s ok, and our house still exists. There is some damage to the property, and there is a small tree on our roof. But nothing that broke the house down at all.</p>

<p>Just goes to show that nature&#39;s probably scarier than any demon. You can exorcise a demon, but you can&#39;t pray a tornado away.</p>

It was just me, my sister, and my dad. Back then, they had a passport package that had you going around the ship looking for plaques on the wall with a ghost sighting story related to that area, plus a part of a puzzle. If you find all the puzzle pieces, it gives an answer relating to the ship and you get a little prize. </p>

<p>So the three of us were going around, looking for the clues. We were just outside the most haunted room, B340, long before they renovated it and opened it up to the public. My sister and dad walked ahead of me, while I lagged behind. Right outside the room, it felt like someone was super pissed off at me and was getting right up in my face, just out of my peripheral vision. Like, you could feel the anger. I quickly turned around, but the three of us were the only ones in the entire hallway. There was no one else there. I ignored it and kept walking, but three seconds later, I felt it again. I looked again and there was still no one there. No one visible, at least. I&#39;d never felt anything like that before or since, even when we returned to the ship two other times.</p>

We had a bed that was against the window that we usually had curtains over, the feeling continued for a year or so. We use to have a small trailer park across the road you could only see the tops of them from the road, my dad went out one day and crossed the street to get the mail he happened to look up and noticed a small hard plastic chair sitting in the roof directly across from out home. An older man lived there I’m not sure what my father did but after a few days I stopped having the feeling of being watched and we were switched rooms.</p>

I was doing a program where you would spend a few nights in one of the retreat centers in the woods, hang out with people until midnight, play board games and stuff, then go to sleep in a room with a couple roommates. </p>

<p>It was the night before New Year’s Eve and I was asleep in my room when the noise of the door opening into the communal hallway woke me. At first, I thought it was one of my roommates, so I tried to close my eyes and go back to sleep. But, as soon as I started to close my eyes, I saw someone enter the room. It looked like the figure of an old woman, but much, much older. As she approached my bed, she got right into my face and I was finally able to shut my eyes again, to avoid looking at her, but as soon as I did, she started screaming right in my ears. It wasn’t words, it was just a bloodcurdling scream. Eventually, I was able to turn over, but she kept screaming and, when she finally did stop, I felt her presence watching me for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>When morning finally came, I sat up, my roommates were sound asleep, and the door was tightly shut. I’ve told this story to a few people and it’s mainly been explained as sleep paralysis, but doesn’t the illusion of that stop once you can move again?</p>

A true spooky conspiracy/story.</p>

<p>(For background, my house is on a fairly large hill surrounded by flat-ish land, maybe a little hilly, with a train station near by.</p>

<p>Everything started when my brother and I were fairly young, around when I was 6 or so. My mother heard a metal-on-metal knocking below her at night. It was strange because she said it sounded as if it were below the house where we slept peacefully. She claims to have heard them many times at night when we were younger and it has started to stop as we grow older. However, after I was told this story (almost 2 years ago), I went to bed and heard exactly what she did. It scared me so much that I had to sleep in the same room as her. My mother, brother, and I talked about this the next day over lunch after I had heard the knocking. She and I tried to explain to him what we heard. Immediately he shot up and remembered that in the woods behind our house he and his friend found two closed bunker-like doors that go into the ground. We immediately went on Google earth to find them and sure enough, he wasn’t lying. What’s really strange is that for years there have been military helicopters and planes flying over our house and directly over the bunker doors ever since my mom has heard the sounds.</p>

<p>As the years went on, she would hear the noise less and less and we wouldn’t see the planes and helicopters as often either. But for some reason recently everything has been coming back. Both my mother and I heard the knocking and there were planes that flew over us. We believe that there is a hidden government owned bunker beneath us hiding something from the world. Who knows what’s down there. My dad doesn’t believe any of it.</p>

<p>To make matters even weirder, my boyfriend mentioned the fact that the train station is only a few minutes from our house. Perhaps they built it close by to ship supplies here via locomotive to build the bunker. </p>

<p>TLDR: my family and I believe that the government is hiding something under our house in a bunker.</p>

<p>This happened to me when I was around nine years old. Sometime in October, my fathers girlfriend killed herself. She hung herself on the hook for a punching bag, that hadn&#39;t had an actual punching bag on it for quite some time, leaving it just as a metal hook, with a joint on it so it could swing. </p>

<p>I was pretty traumatized over this and obviously felt a lot of grief and confusion. The weeks following her death, it can&#39;t have been more than three weeks later, I was up late at my dads house. I couldn&#39;t sleep, since I&#39;d had nightmares about her for quite some time. Around 3 AM or so, I walked up the stairs to grab a glass of water. About halfway up I start hearing the screech of metal rubbing together. </p>

<p>I walk up faster, confused and rubbing my eyes. I stand still at the top of the steps, looking around the living area. My eyes land on the hook where my fathers girlfriend hung herself. It&#39;s moving. I stand still, just watching it. </p>

<p>The hook moves back and forth, back and forth, going faster and faster. It looks like someone is moving it, but there is no one there. The screech and creak of the metal is LOUD. Very loud. I start crying and run down the stairs, back to my bedroom. I keep the lights on and stay awake for as long as I can, staring at the door. </p>

<p>I never told anyone about it, nor did I think about it for several years. I only remembered it again at a sleepover four years or so later. We were telling ghost stories and talking about paranormal experiences. </p>

<p>When I think back on it now, there are definitely more plausible explanations other than GHOSTS. I was tired and grieving. It also doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense that no one else in the house heard the commotion. Although it probably wasn&#39;t the angry ghost of my fathers girlfriend, it&#39;s a hell of a ghost story to tell when that kind of conversation arises.</p>

<p>So, as a teen, I had a pretty open room.  Well, one night, full moon was shining bright as I woke up.  The foot of my bed faced my door, so I also woke up facing the door which led to the attic, and I see it.  Just a human shape, looks like someone in a trench coat with a wide brim hat.</p>

<p>Well, once I noticed it, that was when I felt my blood run cold because I knew it wasn&#39;t anyone I knew by the shape.  It turned, and I could see it was a shadowy mass.  Two red piercing dots accompanied the face, before it merely said one thing.  &#39;You shouldn&#39;t be awake right now.&#39; I laid there, before it started to fade and I could finally move.  I turned over, throwing my blanket over myself and sleeping.</p>

<p>Years later, I looked into it and found information on shadow people.  Would not recommend reading shortly before sleep.</p>

<p>So when I was 7 years old, I used to live with my parents in an apartment overlooking a forest, nothing to do with the actual story just creating a setting.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was in bed asleep, it was like late and stuff, so an hour had passed after i fell asleep and my father decided to go to bed.</p>

<p>However just before he fell asleep I opened the door to his bedroom and woke him up and I said to him &quot;Dad, we need to move and soon&quot;.</p>

<p>He asked why and I replied in a nervous voice &quot;because the man in my room told me&quot;. My father got up to search my room and there was no one there.</p>

<p>A week had passed and my father&#39;s gun that he left in his bedside table also went missing.</p>

<p>I also had a habit of sitting up straight and talking aloud in my sleep in that apartment, but it went away when we moved.</p>

One day I came up stairs to hear him talking but not for his toys with his childish imagination, he was talking to something on his bed, as I walked toward him he screamed,”STOP” confused and startled I stoped, and he said to me with I stare that melted my soul,”Carl said that he doesn’t want you hear”. I bolted and told my parents and they came to the conclusion that it was imaginary friend but I was not convinced. More often then not I found him talking to this Carl. And one day I don’t know why but I asked his last name and he said his name is Carl Williams. I asked about Carl and what he was like my brother explained that he was a sixteen year old who loves kids and hates me because his older brother killed him and that is why he was always so angry at me. I slowly walked to my parents again and explained what he said, they went to him and said not to talk to Carl and after a while he seemed to have stopped. About a month after my brother stopped talking to Carl I went into the basement to do the laundry and with a huge bang I tripped on what seemed to be nothing, as I got up I saw carved into the cement where my face landed the initials C.W. and as I got up I was pushed by something back to the ground my chest hitting the floor, I looked up and there was my brother with cold eyes and a fierce look he said to me, “Carl’s my brother now I don’t need you anymore.” I yelled and struggle but was dizzy from the hit I took and luckily my two younger siblings came down and alerted my parents, they pulled him off me and asked what he could have possibly been thinking and he said with a grin,”You were right Carl that was a fun game” I then proceeded to punch him and screamed in his face to stop talking to him. To this day I can’t tell if he’s my brother or the puppet of Carl waiting for the right time to seek revenge for his death on me.</p>

My room is an en suite and the corner where my door is was always pitch black at night. I would wake up in the middle of the night to see a dark figure standing in the archway near my door that was so tall, it was crouching slightly to look at me. The figure was slim and I couldn&#39;t make out any features, except for the eyes. It was like looking into the void.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I told some of my friends in school about it and they told me they have seen similar things or their friends have seen similar things. I don&#39;t know what this thing is, but I know that it always terrified me every time I saw it.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t stand to keep seeing it every night, so I bought a small night light that I put into my bathroom to light up the corner where the figure would stand. Haven&#39;t seen it since.</p>

My little brother used to kind of &#39;see&#39; things we couldn&#39;t. By things, I mean people. Ghosts maybe? We never knew. </p>

<p>One of the first things that happened was in our kitchen. He was looking up, talking. We asked &quot;who are you taking to&quot;. We figured he was speaking with an imaginary friend maybe, he was 4 after all. 
He then looks at as and says &quot;I&#39;m talking with this uncle&quot;. We were kind of shocked. We asked how did he look like. My brother said he had a big hat. Then we asked his name. My brother looks up at the &#39;man&#39; and asks &quot;what is your name?&quot; 
After a few seconds he says &quot;his name is Géza&quot;, which was really weird, because he never met a guy with this name. And really, neither did we. Géza is kind of an old hungarian name, or at least not that common anymore. 
Then my dad wanted to make a photo of the man, but when he took out his phone, my brother said in almost a carefree tone &quot;oh, well, the uncle is gone&quot;.</p>

<p>There was a lot of other stuff too, but what especially stuck with was a time when he got a toy traktor from our grandpa. After a few days, one of the tires came off, and he was playing with that. I looked at him, while he was playing. He was rolling the tire from the kitchen to the other side of our living room (the two was connected) which wasn&#39;t weird. The weird thing was that it came back. It always came back. Then I stood up, and saw that the little plastic tire always rolled back before it hit the wall. </p>

<p>Oh and there was some old lady in our bedroom too, appearently, but that&#39;s another story.</p>

My younger brother used to play Softball around that time, and was active in some sport each year. Back then, i had a more normal sleep schedule and my bedroom did not have a door that would not lock. I have theorize because my brother played sports. It caused him to start sleep walking. Around those times my Mom or Grandma would share their tales of him but i never saw it.
   My brother and i were somewhat distant in that time. Later to find out we were envious of one another for our own reasons. He would enjoy coming into my room and trying to hang out with me and my gal pals. In that time i would describe jt like; female teen angst parallel to a even stevens Christy Carlson Romano. i would be a upset older sister who just had to bare with his request or anytime he came to bother me. In those years we didn&#39;t really talk mostly my objection for him being in my room.
    One particular night, life played out normal. Wake up, breakfast, school, then come home to decompress while my brother had practice, then dinner and bed. My bed was in a spot where in the small room it was in view if anyone opened the door they can see it. The headboard was against the corner of the room. But i had a preference to lay my head on the foot of the bed. The room was silent, and i remember laying on back starring up towards the ceiling before turning to face the wall against my bed. I think that night i was on my computer a bit later then usual and by the time i was ready to rest. The house was silent. Just before i was ready to sleep in my pitch black room. I saw the hall light start to expand into my room as the door opened up. My eyes kept staring intensely onto the wall as i noticed my brothers silhouette peak a bit. I knew he was at the doorway of my room just standing there. I became quickly away of how uneasy it made me. He didn&#39;t yell, call my name, say a word like he would or rush in. He did nothing but stood motionless peering in for a few minutes. I layed still untill after i saw him turn then oddly turn to make his way elsewhere in the house.</p>

So I walked into my room for whatever reason and instantly stopped in my tracks as I turned around. In the mirror I could see the elbow of a  guy in a tux next to my window. But when I looked at the window no one was there. I started looking from different angles and moving around to see if I can get a better look at the figure, but all I could see was the shoulder down to his waist. The bed and the end of the mirror was cutting my vision of the guy. I stood there for like 5-10 minutes just staring at him, waiting for something to happen. Then my brothers barged in my room and started wrestling on the bed. I tried to get them out as fast as possible diverting my vision to my brothers. But when they left and I looked back at the mirror, he was gone. There&#39;s no explanation for what I saw, so I just lived with it. Never saw him again.</p>

<p>There was other stuff that happened there too, like people sleeping there. The entire third floor was completely vandalised, and there was a random chainsaw in the living room. And when we went to the second floor, it was completely trashed. Out semi-cousins used to live on the second floor, and most of their stuff was still inside.</p>

One of these nightmares was about me walking down into my basement, seeing a cloaked figure, and running back upstairs. At some point the line between reality and dream blurred. I was having the same dream every night and was paranoid to the point of being unable to go into my basement. This went on for quite a few days before I finally got the nerve to go downstairs. Unfortunately for me it felt as if I was having a bizarre case of deja vu. As I began to descend the steps I recognized the atmosphere of the basement immediately.  It was as if I were in my dream, but from my own perspective (in my dream it was from a third person point of view). I descended the stairs and saw what I was terrified of seeing. I’m not sure if it was my brain deceiving me or the shadows cast in the dark hallway of my basement, but in the dim light I could swear I saw a cloaked figure, standing still at the end of the hallway. As in the dream I ran upstairs and tried to explain it to my mom and dad. I didn’t go back into the basement for a while without my parents. After that, the recurring nightmare stopped. It’s been so long that at this point the whole ordeal feels like a dream. But I know that the feeling of terror I got in that moment was too real to be in my head.</p>

My bedroom was originally the old mans den and where he spent most of his time. The first time anything happened was 2 years ago. I was sitting on my bed doing a makeup look when a ring box sitting on top of my jewelry box flew off, hitting the wall next to me. I was a startled, but didn’t think anything of it. Fast forward to around a year ago today. It was getting late so I decided I needed to get some sleep. I was very relax and almost asleep when I felt 2 forearms pound on my bed right next to me. My heart sunk in my chest, I had a cold shiver go down my spine, and I didn’t want to open my eyes. When I did l, no one was there. My mom was still awake in the living room, which is right outside my bedroom, and i asked her if she came in. She replied ‘no’. I have french doors leading into my room, so typically, I can wake up out of a dead sleep if I hear my door open from a cat coming in, that’s how loud my doors are.</p>

<p>It was summer vacation and my family decided to go to a water park, the first thing I do is go into the artificial river and in one of the sections in said river was a wave section. I was a child and did not know how to swim and my mother had told me not to go into the river but I was disobedient in those times. When I get into the wave section I got sucked into the machine that makes the waves, luckily I grabbed the end of the wall just before the part that has no return . Since the current was to strong I screamed on the top of my lungs and the lifeguard came and saved me. To this day I don’t go to that said river.</p>

Just a couple of teens doing teen stuff before I got there.<br/>
What was scary though, is when my roommate was being discharged. I was the only one in my room now as everyone was saying goodbye to them. I waved from my door that was situated at the end of the hall away from everyone else in the main sitting area.<br/>
And from behind me, I hear a little girl say &quot;Goodbye!&quot;. Naturally, I turned around to look for someone. Looked back through the hall and everyone was either in their own rooms for journal time, or down the hall, hugging my roommate. There was no one in my room.<br/>
Same night, I was woken up by something hitting the pillow I was sleeping on, right next to my face. There was what seemed like a hand print when I looked at it. But no one around.</p>

<p>She said that one night she woke up and felt the urge to check on me. She went to my room, turned on the light and on the wall right above my crib there was a tarantula. Hell knows how it even got there, I don&#39;t think they normally live here. Mom ran to get insecticide, heavily sprayed it and put an empty cocoa jar over it. Then she closed the jar and, apparently, never really got rid of it. So we might have a cocoa jar with a tarantula corpse somewhere in the attic.</p>

<p>And I just slept through it all without a care in the world.</p>

Took place a few months ago, before all of this pandemic stuff. I has hanging around my Grandpa&#39;s, spending the day helping him around the farm with my friend. I was a wreck the entire day, and I&#39;m about to tell you why.</p>

<p>For a few days while I was there, I had been seeing things. Or, well, I thought I was seeing things. Basically, out of the corners of my eyes, I&#39;d see something moving. It was black and it&#39;d disappear before I could ever get a proper look. Now, I&#39;m well aware that this could be my mind/eyes playing tricks on me, but this kept happening for days on end while I was there. Even during night time I would still catch this black form moving just outside of my peripheral vision. I was seriously getting paranoid.</p>

<p>I&#39;m naturally a very paranoid man, and one that does believe in the supernatural. So these constant instances made my imaginative mind go a little wild. Like, was it ghost messing with me? A speedy monster looking to play to my paranoia? Or, and this was my most out their and dumbest thought, the spirit of the Wendigo looking to consume? </p>

<p>I ended up losing more than a few hours of sleep over this, which I&#39;m willing to bet didn&#39;t help anything. When I left my Grandpa&#39;s these &quot;sightings&quot; didn&#39;t stop, but they slowed down pretty heavily. Yet even still, every now and then I still see these shadowy figures just barely.</p>

Well, what I had wound up experiencing was more like a very short fever dream: I opened my eyes, vision extremely blurred. I was in a small room that I imagine was part of a hospital. The fluorescent light was slightly tinged what I can only liken to a pestilent yellow-green, like a toxic cloud in a cartoon. I felt like I was restrained. All I really remember seeing in the room was the open door--and the shadow quickly advancing on me, until it stood directly over me. Somehow, I snapped myself out of whatever this was without even consciously attempting to, I was so startled by being thrown into this place that I jumped back out in an instant. All I could feel was my heart racing in my chest. I couldn&#39;t open my eyes. I couldn&#39;t move my hands. And for some reason, I tried going back in, to no avail. Part of me was unsure if what I had seen was actually a dream, or a vision, or whatever. I was then convinced that this shadow man was still standing over me, just staring dead at me. I could still hear the youtube video going in my headphones, but I was still paralyzed, panicking in my own mind for a length of time that could&#39;ve been five, ten, twenty minutes. It was hard to tell how fast time was passing. After rolling my eyeballs around under super-glued eyelids for some length of time, the paralysis finally wore off completely. All in all, I still try to explore what the subconscious has to offer, even though I don&#39;t always like what I find.</p>

Under the basement was a small office and an even smaller storage closet. My family is very large and so I my room ended up being the small office. It was nice having my own level to the house, but of course it had its downsides. Main one being Frank, the spirit who &quot;haunted&quot; my room. Heres some things he did during the two years I lived there (besides constantly feeling another presence in the room). </p>

<p>As I was unpacking a box our first day there, I paused to have lunch with my family. We were all up there the entire time. When I came back down, not only was all the stuff I had just unpacked back in the box, but the box was folded shut. I thought maybe I had imagined unpacking the box, but we taped them all shut before we moved, so it was weird that it was folded.</p>

<p>One night at like 2 am I was going down the stairs (in the dark because I was just sneaking food or something) and ran into something so hard I fell back and I thought I broke my nose. I started getting really mad, thinking it was my sister that was standing in the steps to try and scare me or something. I turned on the light and there was literally nothing. I got super freaked out and slept on the living room couch that night</p>

<p>Everyone knew about Frank, but very few people actually dealt with him. My sister knew there was something going on in my room but she wasnt sure she believed in Frank himself. There was one day she was in my room, sitting on my bed, back to the door. I was telling her about how cold it had been in my room that week (it was mid July) and she jokingly said &quot;it must be Frank.&quot; Right at that moment, an empty box hit her on her back, like it had been thrown at her. It had been sitting peacefully on the shelf and I still cant think of a &quot;rational&quot; explanation for that one. It took her a good two months to come back into my room.</p>

<p>Last one. This happened at least once a week, but never every day. If I slept with my face towards the room, I would see a show pacing back and forth all night and it really freaked me out to watch. So I would sleep towards the wall. But sometimes I could feel someone sit down on the bed. You know the feeling? You&#39;re laying down and they slowly put their weight on the mattress and your body falls towards them? Like that. But one one was there. I slept with my door closed, so I&#39;d know if someone came in. I swear on my life, I would turn around and no one was there. After a while I stopped looking because I knew. It was Frank</p>

<p>So I don’t really know how to start this off or even kinda explain it but here it goes. </p>

<p>So these types of coincidence happen and they happen at least twice a day. I can guess what people are saying, what there are going to do next. And this can happen in real time, during a tv show, objects basically anything. </p>

<p>I can guess if something is going to fall or it’s gonna make loud noise later stuff like that, and it happens. But it’s like, I don’t know if it’s going to happen. I’ll just be like, “It’s gonna fucking drop later” or “You better not fucking scare me have to death later, or I swear to god!” Stuff like that </p>

<p>Now during tv shows I can guess what people are going to say or what they’re going to do. Like with the show “You.” I guessed the second girl’s name Joe meets (the main character if you don’t know). Before she said her name, I was like “how ironic would it be if her name was Love?” (And for those of you would don’t know that’s her name). And then she said her name, and I flipped. I was like there is nooooo way that I just guessed that! But it happened. </p>

<p>Or I could go on Instagram and just scroll through the explore page because quarantine is boring, and I’ll see something about one of my favorite shows of all time “Supernatural” and I’ll be like “oh I remember that episode, they met God in that one” and I’ll scroll more then go to Netflix and watch “Supernatural.” Then somehow, out of all fourteen (14) seasons that are on Netflix, I’ll manage to pick the exact one where they met God. And that happens aaaaall the time.</p>

<p>Now with real time, I’ll make bets with people. Me, my sister and my mom will be sitting in the living room together and let’s say my sister gets up to make food. I’ll bet my mom like 5 bucks that she’s gonna run into the coffee table in her way back to the couch. Then she’s done making her food and makes her way back to the couch, and you’ll never guess, she runs into the coffee table. Then I get money</p>

<p>So that’s my story on coincidences that happen everyday. Probably no ones gonna believe me because I have no proof, but it felt good to rant.</p>

My school would go across the street to the playground every now and then. So one day we went and as being a playful little kid, I was playing tag with my friends. So I remember I was running really fast and I looked back to see who was chasing me and when I looked back I ran right into a pole and cause my self to have a dent in my head had about 10 stitches. So my mom and my moms friend had taken me out the hospital and I was looking out the window and I swear on everything that I have. There was a someone in a black hoodie, who put his thumb on one side of his neck and slid it across to the other side. And I said it to my mom as I was watching it and they literally u turned back to that corner the split second I said wat was going and there was nobody there. Literally nobody there, like it was open field so u can tell if someone was running away but there absolutely no one. That is one of my earliest experience. I have others that I can share if anyone else would like to hear.</p>

One was of the father getting pulled into a closet and the other clothes from a pile rising up and forming a shape. I went to bed scared out of my mind. I had a nightmare about the two scenes except it was me who really was experiencing all of it. I woke up with sweat pouring off of my 5-6 year old face, still scared out of my mind. That’s when I heard breaking up in the attic and a loud bang out side my door. And me being stupid, I had a laundry pile by the door. It was then that I thought I saw my clothes float up and form a shape. I hid underneath my covers for a good while then I peeked it just the slightest bit. And it was gone, I got up to investigate and the pile was still normal. I eventually threw the pile somewhere else in the room so I wouldn’t have to see it. And till this day it still somewhat creeps me out.</p>

I woke up in the middle of the night from probably a dream or something. I sat up in my bed, eyes still closed, but felt something push me back down. I opened my eyes and all I could see was a dark figure, seemed very tall, pushing down on my chest with one hand, the other heading towards my throat. It looked simply like a solid shadow holding me down. I could feel myself pretty much being choked by one hand of this thing. I&#39;m not sure how I was able to do it, but I managed to, through the pressure on my throat, cry out &quot;Get off of me!&quot; Once I said that, it released the pressure from my throat and chest, turned away, and walked through my bedroom door. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Ever since that incident, I have been very prone to seeing shadow people, though never had as close of an encounter as I did that first time.</p>

I heard the shower from the bathroom turn on a little and made a tapping noise as it hit the floor.There was no one was in the bathroom. Then I saw the door creaked open with an outline of a women.

I was home alone after school on Halloween 2019 when I decided to take a nap on the couch, which is a normal ritual for me as I’m a senior in high school with a terrible sleeping pattern.</p>

<p>Thinking nothing of the date I drift off to sleep when I start to hear human breathing next to me. Due to the fact I have slept next to friends, partners and family members in the past this was not something that woke me up. It wasn’t until I opened my eyes and realised I was alone that I started to freak out. I have always felt like I’ve been watched in the house from behind the couch but this was next level.</p>

<p>Later that night at 1am or so, I was finally starting to go to sleep when I felt like I was being watched. I felt someone standing at the end of my bed watching me, swaying back and forth. They then slowly slink down and hover their hands around my ankles. I refuse to move so I don’t provoke whatever has entered my room. They then stand up again and walk over to my door where the stand and watch me trying to sleep for about 2 hours. I heard it’s footsteps on my wooden floor even though there were clothes everywhere. Still freaks me out to this day</p>

Will. Will and I were bored, our parents chatting away in the dining room. I asked him if he wanted to go outside and avoid hearing his own baby stories, and he agreed. We went out on my small pond I have in the front yard, sitting in the sand and talking for a while. Soon, I had the brillant idea, to summon a demon. I thought for a while and then came up with an idea of how to do it. This is where, you may not believe me. I lit a stick and drew a symbol in the sand, we held hands, I held the stick. I played a song to go with the symbol and we waited. Then we heard a sudden high pitched screech in the woods. I booked it back into the house, Will following close behind. The sticks flame going out. I sat baffled on the couch, looking at him scaredly about what we just did. After it occured nothing had  happened, I thought things were over. Months passed, I went down to my old treefort in the back forest. I walked up to it and I still remember what I saw. I saw a figure, half in front of me, half of him hidden behind the tree. It continued to happen, I thought my brain was playing tricks on me. But, more of my friends saw it. My brother, he was two at the time, saying he saw a white and black tall figure in the forest. Finally, it stopped after a while. But.. I have had paranoia ever since. I became uncomfortable by myself. I still wake up at night sometimes, to something staring at me. Of course, when I open my eyes, its gone. I later learned he got rid of the demon for me, he had heard the same high pitched screech as before, when a demon like that enters and exits, something will die both times. That day, was one of my biggest mistakes. Dont mess with what you dont know. Especially, when it wants to leave.</p>

It was a decent school but the only problem was that it’s an old school and things were breaking frequently. Most of the schools bathrooms were closed for renovations. I try to avoid going to the bathroom at school but today I just couldn’t hold it. The nearest bathroom was in the basement of the school. And I wasn’t willing to walk to the farthest one, so I went down the two flights of stairs to the basement. It was creepy down there. Especially because there was that one light that would flicker on and off. When you first get to the basement there&#39;re 3 doors. One door with a staff only sign on it, the door for the gum, and the bathroom door. I ran into the bathroom and into the stall not seeing anybody. But maybe I ran in to fast to notice. Then I hear a voice. “Hey what’s your name?” I told them my name. Then they asked. “How old are you? What class are you in?” I told them, but then they stopped asking questions, and I was a little scared to leave the stall, so I asked “is anybody there?” But no response, so I slowly opened the stall door. And there was someone standing in the back corner of the bathroom. I RAN AND I HEARD FOOTSTEPS BEHIND ME. As I ran up the stairs I guess one of the teachers heard the noise because there was a teacher standing at the top of the stairs. They asked what’s wrong? I looked behind me and nobody was there. I told her what happened, and we went to the principals&#39; office. The principal checked the cameras to see who it was. And nobody had gone in or out of the bathroom other than me. There were no windows in the bathroom for them to get in or out from. Now that school is closed. Has been for the last 7 years. It’s been un touched and people have gone there and claimed to see someone walking around inside.</p>

It first happened when I was eight years old. At night the room was always dark except for the nightlight. One night I woke with a cold sweat. I looked across the room at my nightlight but my eyes focused on something else. There was a dark shadow by it. Tall as my door the shadow stood (about 6&#39;8). Facing me. It turned its head to the side. As if to acknowledge that it knew I was looking. The panic in me rose but I didn&#39;t want to get up. Fearing whoever or whatever it was would move. So I stared at it and it stared at me. I tilted my head back to let it know I was aware of its presence. Then IT WAVED ITS ARM. Not much but a slight raise. My heart pounded faster, but I waved back anyway. I remember staring for a long time till the sun came up. But when the sun shone through the window the shadow faded. As it faded it nodded and I didn&#39;t see it for a long time. 6 years later-- I thought I would never see that shadow again. But here it was. At this point i was 14. I awoke again with a cold sweat. Thinking it was nothing I was just going to go back to sleep. But the nightlight provided enough to have me see it again. I had to be hallucinating. Surely the shadow figure couldn&#39;t be here. I had moved residency, for it to be here it would have to have followed me here. But why here why now? I looked at it and it nodded to me. I nodded back, terrified. I waved to see if it was friendly. Then it did something that should have made me scream. It waved and began to walk towards me! But then it stopped at the light. It seemed to be held back. It turned its head down and I followed it&#39;s gaze. The light was shining through it&#39;s legs?! As lucky as it was for me I couldn&#39;t help to feel bad all of a sudden. It seemed to be in pain but I was not about to get up to help. I don&#39;t know why but I was no longer panicked and I wasn&#39;t afraid of it. I waited till the sun rose and the shadow began to fade. I rose and turned off the nightlight. The shadows legs returned. And he gave a wave. I knew he would be back. 4 months later-- I stopped using the nightlight. Hoping that the shadow would return. I don&#39;t know why but I wasn&#39;t afraid of it. More I was curious of why it had followed me here. Then I felt the cold sweat and I knew it was back. I looked up from my bed and it was there. This time not in the corner but right in front of the bed. This was it. No nightlight to keep it away. I could only pray that my conscience was true that it was no threat. I waved at it mirrored the gesture. I scooted over and offered it a seat on the bed. And it sat. I know this whole thing is crazy but i swear I could hear it whisper to me. It was just a lonely soul looking for a friend. And it knew my heart would allow something terrifying to the eye a chance. And I&#39;m happy so say I&#39;m glad I did. 4 years later- Now I greet the shadow as an old friend. It follows me everywhere but only appears if it needs someone to talk to. It has no name so I just call it my friend. This cant be true I still say to myself. Shadows don&#39;t talk or come to life maybe its just a reoccurring dream.</p>

My mom was in the shower and my three younger sisters were playing in my youngest sisters bedroom. My dad was in bed, asleep. It was just my dog and I out there.  My kitchen is next to my living room.  The only thing that separates the two are the difference floor patterns.  Now for the creepy part.  All of a sudden I felt like someone was walking towards the living room.  I was faced the other way petting my dog.  I turn around and all I see is a dark, tall,  human like figure walking passed the kitchen.  My dog and I just stop and stare at wear it had walked. We both saw it.  I tried rationalizing it. “Maybe it’s mom.  She was probably just wearing a black shirt and I didn’t see right”.  So, I go over to where the figure walked to.  My dog went in front of me, leading the way.  He was alert. He usually runs up to my mom at first sight.  But instead he stayed next to me. We walk to where we saw the figure go. <em>There was no one there.</em>  It was around Christmas time and our tree was still up but not turned on. So I look around it hoping to see my mom plugging the lights in. there was no one. I look down at my dog, who was still standing next to me.  He was equally as terrified.  He looks behind us where <em>it</em> came from.  He looked around where <em>it</em> may have walked.  It’s only when he looks up at me, that my mom walks down the hallway. And she was not wearing black.</p>

<p>i swear if a demon possessed our Christmas tree, I’m going to be mad.</p>

Dread and panic took over my body while I had just had a nightmare and was looking instinctually at my closet. I kept thinking and panicking that something was going to come out of it and kill me.. about 1 minute and 30 seconds had passed and I was able to move again. I&#39;d never wish that on anyone. Really a terrifying moment.</p>

<p>I was in my parents bed with my mom and woke up in the middle of the night. I turned over to face my mom only to find another woman lying between us on her side, facing me. I immediately assumed she was my aunty so I didn’t react. Although she seemed shocked by me noticing her and slowly sat up. She said “I’m sorry, I have to go now sweetie”, slid off the end of the bed and walked out the door. I didn’t feel like I was in any danger so I just went back to sleep.</p>

<p>I always thought it might have been something I made up, but it turns out my mom remembers it too. She told me next day I had asked why aunty was in her bed that night. My aunty hadn’t been in our house that night and lives nowhere near us.</p>

<p>About a week after moving into my new apartment, I woke up in the middle of the night and looked around my room. Everything was the same except my mirror had been moved to an adjacent wall. Then I saw a dark figure float by in the mirror&#39;s reflection. My half-asleep brain told me, &quot;It must be my boyfriend. He was here earlier so I guess he just never left.&quot; A moment later, I felt the figure appear in the bed with me. It was behind me, almost on top of me. I tried to elbow it off of me but I couldn&#39;t move my arm. Then I felt it lean into my ear and scream in a raspy voice, &quot;fuck you.&quot; I tried to scream but I couldn&#39;t breathe. It felt like I was being suffocated. I woke up/snapped out of it a second later and I was hyperventilating and my heart was beating out of my chest.  </p>

<p>Imagine being a demon sent all the way from hell just to tell some random girl to go fuck herself.</p>

<p>Being around 2013 - 2015 I remember being a massive fan of Markiplier, Pewdiepie, Cryatoic, etc and all there gameplays (Lmao I still am so dont come @ me) I remember one night I had accidently stayed up lately once again, it was around 3am when I had heard a young girl giggling, I was freaked out, but I decided that it was late and it was probably my mind playing tricks, so I turned up the volume and continue watching. </p>

<p>In the same week, it was day time and I was just minding my own buisness (probably doing something stupid) but I suddenly heard the same little girl giggle, I decided to check over my house and nothing seemed to show any sign of a girl giggling. My mum had been home that day so I asked my mum if she heard a girl giggling or if there where any sign of a girl in the area and she dissagreed.</p>

After some digging, I discovered this thing called hynopompic hallucinations and realized that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been experiencing. They&#39;re akin to sleep paralysis but you can move and you&#39;re, in my experience, a lot more aware. </p>

<p>So, the first time this had happened was when I was about 6 years old. I grew up in a religious household and this scared me to death because I thought I was being visited by demons... Obviously, I wasn&#39;t but it still freaked me out because I was a 6 year old girl whose weapon at hand would likely be a plush bear. Anyway, I woke up in the middle of the night and it was raining. It was pounding. The wind was whipping as well. Perfect set up for one of my most unsettling memories. It looked like the lights from my windows were flashing on my walls, it had a strobe-like effect and it looks as if the shadows that were there were stalking around my room. The reason it felt like I was visited by demons was because it looked like some of the shadows were upside down crosses. One of them, that was close to the ceiling, even dropped and disappeared into the shadows... So that was my first experience with hynopompic hallucinations!! If I&#39;m honest, it probably didn&#39;t help that my family used to watch those &quot;The Haunting&quot; shows at night. </p>

<p>From there on, I had a few smaller and still equally freaky experiences. I woke up and had a spider on my chest that whenever I blinked would get bigger and bigger, changing in colors and size as well. I had masks floating above me and taunting me. These two occured while I was still in elementary school. </p>

<p>They stopped for a while and the only one I remember having in middle school was possibly the least scary. It was was more of a sleep paralysis experience and I had little gnomes walking over me as if I was a road block in their work... I remember struggling to move so much and that&#39;s the only real reason why that one scared me because with all the other ones, I can put my head under a blanket and pretend it&#39;s not there. These stupid lil gnomes though? I was in sleep paralysis for them, of course. </p>

<p>The most recent one I had was the reason I decided to look into the science of all this. It wasn&#39;t horrifying like my first one but it haunts me in another way. I was staying in a hotel room for my brother&#39;s college graduation down in Houston. I was around 16 at the time and again, hadn&#39;t experienced one of these hallucinations in a while. I woke up and I saw the light shine in from the hallway. I was confused, looked over to my parents&#39; bed and they were both still there. There was no reason for there to be any lights on. The I saw her. This was the first time I really had a detailed hallucination of a human. She had short brown hair, cut right above her ears and brown eyes. She had an orange and white top on. She felt warm, like she seemed like one of those people who embody the sun and just radiate sweet and safe energy. This woman walked over to my bed very slowly and made the &#39;shh&#39; gesture before pointing behind her to the far corner of the room. A tall dark figure stood there, reaching up to meet the ceiling with their face covered by a plague mask. The woman disappeared and I was left staring at this figure. Like a switch in my mind went off, I turned around and tried to sleep. It was hard to... especially since I started to notice my parents&#39; snoring again after this lil adrenaline rush haha. </p>

<p>That last experience had me reeling. I figured all the stuff while I was young may have been weird kid experiences but for it to happen when I was old enough to have my driving permit? It had to be something more. It wasn&#39;t sleep paralysis (again, apart from those blasted gnomes) because I could always move, I was always awake and vividly consciously of what was happening. Eventually, I came across hypnopompic hallucinations and I was so thankful to discover that I&#39;m not the only one who has super vivid hallucinations when they randomly wake up. I haven&#39;t had one in a while and with how freaky they usually are, I&#39;m honestly cool with that haha. </p>

I am a very skeptical person so the dream I can explain but the road I can not. I was driving back from my girlfriends place late one night. There’s a few blocks from our places so it isn’t a far but I have to pass by a dark wooded area. As I drove past it I see out of the corner of my eye a black human figure moving faster than I can react directly to my drivers window, not in front of my car so I could have seen it in the light but directly at ME. I have no time to react so all I can do is brace for an impact......which never came. When an impact should have happened instead I was filled with true fear stronger than anything I can remember. The only details I can remember about the figure was it was all black, hand arms not proportional to a humans, and it was very thin. </p>

<p>The dream was about me dying so if you want to hear about it just let me know.</p>

It was a tall dark figure and it was Pitch Black like jet black. I was so scared that I I immediately spun around to look what was behind me. But it was nothing, it was just my door. This happened about two more times until I heard something coming up the stairs. I was so terrified that I ran straight to my bed I slammed the door and I ran up to my bunk bed and head right under my covers. Before I came in I did turn the bathroom light off. So sat there for about 10-minutes, but to me it felt like hours, I heard the Door Creek open I was terrified. I peeked from my covers to see what was standing there because I thought it was my father, but it was not. It was the tall docks for you from there except this time with glowing red eyes and a hat. I remember it picked up something from my room I think it was a doll and left the door open just watching me. I can feel that it wanted to come closer to me but couldn&#39;t, and that made me feel a little bit safer. After that I saw a few more darks figures coming up behind it. The bathroom light was on behind them so I could see them clearly</p>

So much that I would say that the majority of my dreams are lucid. Usually I&#39;ll just go along with whatever the dream is and not interfere too much unless it starts to get scary or disturbing. About a year ago, I was having a lucid dream where I was in 1930s New York City. I don&#39;t remember the specific details of the beginning of the dream, only that I was messing around with gangsters and whatknot and generally having a good time. What is ingrained in my memory is when I accidentally stumbled into some sort of mafia meeting in a darkened room through a door in an alleyway. I was struck by a feeling of dread and, weirdly enough, a sense that they were deciding my fate. As I didn&#39;t like the direction this dream was taking, I decided to change it. But just as I was about to change the dream, a man that I hadn&#39;t seen before stepped out of the shadows, looked me dead in the eye, and said &quot;I wouldn&#39;t try that if I were you&quot;. I jolted awake and couldn&#39;t sleep for the rest of the night. The most unsettling part is that somehow the man was me. Not as in he had my physical features, his face and everything else was different, as in I just knew that he was me. I haven&#39;t had a dream like this since.</p>

<p>TL;DR I was lucid dreaming and somehow a character in my dream knew that and stopped me from controlling the dream.</p>

I woke up in the middle of the night with he feeling of something heavy on me. I thought that it was just me being tired but I looked anyway, but what I did not expect to see was leaning over me... Just staring...<br/>
It was a bony, shadowy figure that had 2 huge, plain white eyes with no other facial features. I thought it was just my head playing with me so I rubbed my eyes. It was still there. I kept doing it hoping for it to disappear but it never went away. It seemed that every time I continued to close my eyes and open them again, it&#39;s face got closer and closer to mine. I tried my best not to make a noise as I didn&#39;t want to wake my parents up because they had work. So just I turned over onto my side, put the blanket over my head and tried my hardest to sleep.  </p>

<p>Ever since that day, I see it standing in the corner of my room most days. Some days its in different places in my room or just isn&#39;t there at all. I still hide under my blankets until 5 in the morning, watching shows on my iPad and sleep.</p>

Accidents happen at these places, right? Well one specific story stands out from the rest. Apparently one of the people in the military was shot in my school and people say that his spirit is still haunting the building today. I, being the little kid I was, believed this story. I actually thought there was a ghost in the school.</p>

<p>My story:<br/>
I was maybe 8 at the time. It was about 8 am on a Wednesday and I sat alone in the hallway outside my classroom waiting for my other classmates and my teachers to come. In this hallway there&#39;s three doors, one of which is a glass door leading into another hallway with a room at the end of it to the right. </p>

<p>I was staring at the glass door lost in thought when two shadows suddenly appeared form the room at the end of the hallway beyond the door I was starring at. I didn&#39;t think much of it until the shadows started to move, it was apparently the headmaster and the janitor. So I said hi and went back to starring at the door and...there was another shadow. This shadow didn&#39;t move tho, it was just there.</p>

<p>So I decided to go and look in the room, there was no one there and the lights were off, the shadow was suddenly gone. The thing is, there&#39;s no windows in the hallways nor the room because this is underneath the school so it couldn&#39;t have been the shadow of a tree nor a bush.

<p>I sleep in a bunk bed on the bottom, used to share with my brother but he moved out. It&#39;s metal and it&#39;s pretty easy to tell when it&#39;s moving. Almost every night when I&#39;m asleep I feel the bed slightly shaking. At first I thought it was a small earthquake but when I would check the next morning there would be no such occurrence. One night it shook so much that I could hear the metal itself creak. I got out of bed thinking it&#39;s definitely an earthquake but when I stood up, the ground wasn&#39;t shaking. I looked at my bed and caught it shaking for a second before it stopped right when my attention was on it. 
I still thought that it was an earthquake and my sleepy brain was seeing things but when I asked my mom the next morning if she felt anything, she said no. </p>

<p>I still feel it shaking sometimes but I&#39;ve learned to ignore it. 
The shaking I can deal with now, but occasionally, I hear footsteps in my room. It&#39;s hard to sneak around in my room since the floor os vinyl. I usually tell myself it&#39;s probably my mom checking on me in the night but when I ask, she always says no. 
Sometimes I see things out of the corner of my eye, but I&#39;ve opted to pretend it isn&#39;t there. </p>

<p>I also hear noises coming from our ceiling, it sounds like scittering of little claws and paws, I just tell myself it&#39;s probably a little animal that got in, even though I know it&#39;s sealed off well.</p>

One night, my mom was on the porch, my grandma was making dinner and I was in my grandma‘s bedroom listening to music and watching YouTube. All of a sudden, the power goes out and there is a loud boom. I ran to the door to leave the bedroom, but the door wasn’t opening. Now, this house was over 100 years old, and the doors would always get jammed. I then hear my mom run in through the front door screaming for my grandma to call 911. Once I finally get out, I run to my mom to see what happened. She said that something scary happened outside. I was really interested so I ran outside. It turns out that the utility pool in my grandmas yard had exploded (my grandma lived out in the country, that’s why there was a pole in her front yard). It was engulfed in flames. This may not seem that scary, but I used to suffer from slight PTSD when it came to fire, due to events that happened years ago. The very top of the pole was barely hanging on. It was kinda flopped to the side. The part that was hanging to the side was right above the garage, and at any moment, it could’ve fallen, setting the garage on fire. The police and fire department arrived and they took care of things. They told us that they had just recently gotten a few calls from other people that lived semi-close to my grandma that their electricity went out for no reason. We stayed outside the rest of the day, given that the power was out.</p>

<p>My parents and I were on our way back from a ski trip in Vermont. We had to leave a couple of days early because of the gruesome snow storm that was going to hit. Had we stayed, we would have been snowed in for who knows how long.</p>

<p>We were driving on the highway going south. Vermont is beautiful. You can be surrounded by forests, mountains, or the sheer face of a cliff. Everything was covered in about a foot of snow so it was absolutely gorgeous. </p>

<p>We come through a pass where you have two sheer rock faces on either side. I notice ahead a white car smashed into the rock. The front end of the vehicle was completely crushed inward. Steam is billowing from the engine, and the silhouettes of two individuals in the driver and passenger seat can be seen slumped downward- completely lifeless.</p>

<p>I immediately sit upright, fastening my hands around the car seat in front of me. &quot;Mom, Dad! Shouldn&#39;t we call 911?&quot; They&#39;re confused, and their slow response annoys me as we&#39;re about to pass the car.</p>

<p>My mom who is looking at the beautiful scenery around us asks, &quot;what are you talking about?&quot;</p>

<p>I quickly state, my tone of voice with utmost urgency, &quot;The car on the side of the road! There was a major accident and no one was stopping to see if they were okay!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t see the car crash. Are you sure it wasn&#39;t some abandoned car on the road?&quot;</p>

<p>At that point the car had passed us. But I saw what I saw. It puzzled me on the drive home, but the more I thought about it, I realized that there were no tracks leading up to the car.</p>

<p>I truly think I saw a ghost. I also think it could have been a warning. What if we had left a day too late when the storm hit?</p>

<p>Tl; dr: Ghost.</p>

<p>My wife and I live in Alaska and were invited to a wedding in the fall, an absolutely beautiful time of the year. We were excited for the road trip required though Alaska is a massive state and for us to reach our destination would require about an 8 hour drive. This means we left our city at 4am to arrive on time.</p>

<p>As the sun was starting to rise, we were on the outskirts of a town named Healy, a beautiful mining and touristy town just before Denali, currently surrounded by an unimaginable amount of golden fall colors. We could at last appreciate the autumn leaves around us now that we could finally see it. We actively watched for wildlife, a moose, maybe a bear if we&#39;re lucky but instead we found rabbits. Dead rabbits.</p>

<p>The occasional roadkill here and there wasn&#39;t unusual nor was it strange to find something that met an unpleasant end along the side of the Parks Highway but we quickly noticed as we drove that it wasn&#39;t just one rabbit or two but many. It was one after the other and no other vehicle or anyone else in sight. I believe we counted over thirty dead rabbits over the course of five miles. We were intrigued and curious. So curious that we did not realize we drove into fog.</p>

<p>Now, any Alaskan can tell you that fog during this time of the year and so early in the morning is hardly out of the ordinary so we didn&#39;t think anything of it and it wasn&#39;t strange we were alone. What was unusual was all the death and we continued seeing more dead rabbits. Many more inside the fog. After a few minutes driving into the mist, we finally saw another vehicle approaching us, with a single functional headlight. Again, this wasn&#39;t unusual but we couldn&#39;t wrap our heads around what we saw next.</p>

<p>As the vehicle passed us, we immediately saw how destroyed it was. The vehicle looked like it had rolled multiple times, it&#39;s roof caved in, windows smashed out and dents all over. It was amazing the vehicle was functional at all but as we got closer, we couldn&#39;t believe our eyes there was no driver. No signs of life at all around the vehicle that passed us and as soon as it was gone, so was the fog and the rabbits. Before we knew it, we were back on the road just outside Healy left speechless.</p>

<p>Nobody believes us when we tell this story and being honest, we don&#39;t blame them. While we love the fact we have such a weird unique experience between us that only we could understand, we can&#39;t help but wonder what the story was behind it all and five years later, we still think about it to this day.</p>

I had gone to my junior prom and drove myself to meet my friends there. We left around 11pm and I got in my car and drove off. I was really tired and a fairly in experienced driver. And it took me a while to realize I was going in the wrong direction on a main road. So I used my phone to figure out a way home. It was probably between 11:30 or 12 and my phone told me to make a left and I went down a stretch of road that turned into a dirt road in a clearing in a forrest. I was driving my old civic and it was not doing well on the road. Then I saw something person size cross in front of me in the clearing. I started skiting after braking and braced for impact. I didn&#39;t feel a hit and I looked up and nothing was there. I was to scared to get out and thought I would just yell out my window &quot;Is anyone there?&quot; The response I got was a gut wrenching scream from the distance that I couldn&#39;t identify as person or beast and out of pure fear I hit the gas and sped off and was soon on the main road pointing home. I later found out that that area had had sighting of large animals as well as the jersey devil. I don&#39;t believe in it, but I have no idea what had crossed me that night</p>

I knew my dad left to drop of my older brother at his mom&#39;s house, and I didn&#39;t know where my twin brother went, I couldn&#39;t find him, so I went down to go to my dad&#39;s room, since some of my cousins have rooms down there, they can be hanging downstairs, no one was down there at the time. Since I was young, I was scared about the basement, and so I&#39;d run, but while I was running down the hall, I heard footsteps behind me, so I ran harder, when I reached my dad&#39;s door, I turned behind me, and saw a weird creepy face staring out the bathroom, staring straight at me. It was a white face with a creepy-ass smile, and just not looking right. I ran into the room, and cried in fear. It took a couple of minutes for me to muster the courage to run back upstairs. I later figured out my twin brother went with my dad.</p>

<p>Another time, in the same house, I was in my twin cousins&#39; room, they weren&#39;t there at the time, and I was in there with my older brother and twin brother. They were sleeping while I was on my new 3ds, playing with my miis I made. And there was a huge, somewhat old, box-ish TV playing a certain channel. It was 11 at night when I heard and felt a ringing in my ears and at the top of my eye I saw a huge black shadow standing in front of the TV. I looked up and nothing was there. I was so freaked out I decided to just go to bed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 14 right now, almost 15, and so it&#39;s been about half a decade, and I don&#39;t know what happened at that house.</p>

I&#39;ll just pick the one that impacted me the most instead of the one that happened last night. When I was 11, since I&#39;m 16 now, I was hanging out with a friend. She and I were having a sleepover and she decided to pull out a ouija bored and she and I messed with obviously being a dumb kid. We talked to a little girl on the bored and I don&#39;t remember her name. But the next day when I was going to sleep I felt something watching me. I looked over at my closet and I saw a tall black figure in my closet and I could only see it&#39;s eyes and it&#39;s teeth. I turned over to ignore it while panicking and I look at the foot of my bed and it was sitting there staring at me and it grabbed my leg it felt like my leg was on fire. I pulled away sitting up and turning on the light and got my mom. This went on for almost a month before we put crosses around my room and smudged sage around the room while my mom said a prayer tht night it was gone and I haven&#39;t seen it since then until last night. I just saw it again and I felt burning on my back and I ran to my sister and she was shocked to see scratches on my back we smudged my room again and I didn&#39;t sleep at all that night and I kept my light on. That&#39;s my spooky story.(edit)
 I decided to add both stories because really they tied together.</p>

<p>It was a normal day going home from music school as always. As soon as I crossed the road a questionably looking-poor man has gone to the same path as I am walking on. My gut said: ”„RUN RUN THAT HOBO IS GONNA SELL YOUR ORGANS!!!&quot;
I ran but when I looked back he was the same distance away just how it was before. I kept running to my home with my legs going SUPER SONIC! As I ran to the apartment door and opened it I looked near the path I just ran. THE HOBO WAS NEAR THE NEIGHBORING APARTMENT! I ran to the door and tried to forget about it.
Moral of the story: Listen to your gut don&#39;t let death&#39;s scissors cut your unique life string so early.</p>

<p>Extra story!
I was home alone playing some games on my computer games and I needed to go pee. I did the obvious and went to the toilet and of course peed. As soon as my hand touched the handle my gut decided to lock the door and not go out.
My anxiety, stress and fear made a triple triangle combo of doom. I was so scared that I just listened tough the door and there were a lot of sounds. I went on my phone chatted with a guy on Amino. He told me: „Bruh, if you&#39;re seriously are that scared then call the police. I refused but before I knew it my battery died. I sat and listened to the sounds. My mom came home and she was pretty disappointed. So yes I sat in a bathroom for 2 hours until mom came home.</p>

At first I thought it was my dog but then I realized that my dog was in my bed. When I opened my door it was pitch black in the hall so I tried to look down the hall and I saw something that looked like a pair of eyes staring at me I quickly grabbed my flashlight that I leave on my dresser that I use to walk my dog at night. I turned it on and say something standing at the end of the hall. As soon as I could see the thing my light went out and I heard laughing. I quickly shut my door and locked it. Once it was morning I asked my family if they had heard anything that night. Everyone said no. Since then I make sure to lock my door at night and I have a light that I plug in that turns on if someone is walking in my room.</p>

<p>I was on the cough, sleeping away, darkness covering everything. And then suddenly, I wake up. At least i felt like i did. I was still at the exact same spot in which i fell alseep. I just thought &quot;oh i must&#39;ve woken up&quot; until i heard voices.</p>

<p>There were voices coming from the room. They were not from my head because i could hear various locations from where they came. They started talking with me, and the weird thing is, i went along with it. Like it was something that I&#39;ve experienced before. </p>

<p>Eventually i got worried because they were saying some weird stuff. They must&#39;ve noticed how worried i was and started talking about it. They started saying things like &quot;dont leave us&quot; or &quot;stay here&quot;. It was getting real creepy and just as fast as i woke up, I fell asleep again.</p>

<p>TDLR: weird voices were weird in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>I live in a small rural town in Montana, which is home to the old haunted state prison. It’s a pretty big deal here, we hold a lot of important events there including memorial ceremonies and holiday events. So, you can assume I’ve been there quite a few times, and I have! I actually used to work reception at the front desk for daytime walk in tours, and I would help with the spooky nighttime ghost tours. </p>

<p>I’ve had my fair share of experiences there, but only small things. By far, this is quite possibly my scariest experience. </p>

<p>We had a school event one night, where we were locked in until maybe three in the morning. For ten dollars we were given a ghost tour of the prison and we got to watch movies and even participate in a hypnotist show! They did this every year that I went through high school, and I went every year. There’s not a lot to do in this town and it’s always fun to go visit the prison! </p>

<p>I believe this was my senior year of high school. This year I went with my really good friend M, who was working there at the time. Everyone else was busy that night so it was just the two of us, a couple of annoying freshman, some other people I know were there and can’t remember, and our junior friends K and A, who happened to show up as well. We went through most of the ghost tour having to deal with the freshman who honestly ruined the entire experience by talking. It felt like it was set up to be a pretty uneventful night. </p>

<p>At one point in the ghost tours, guests are lead up into the death tower, where the 1959 riot’s perpetrators met their end. Our little group of highschoolers all piled in to the tight space, backs pressed to the walls as our guide used the spirit box in the middle. I was pressed between K and M on the wall, and we were all a little psyched out since the spirit box was talking back to us. </p>

<p>It was absolutely dead quiet up there aside from our guide talking. Once she started to wrap things up, we all started to leave too. As we were all headed towards the stairs, we heard the loudest BANG from down the stairs, that sounded like a gunshot and echoed upstairs to us. It sent us all scrambling back to the wall, M and I were holding onto each other, it was a whole mess. </p>

<p>Our first coherent thoughts after the terror were mostly filled with; oh my GOD we REALLY pissed off these ghosts! Maybe worse! Someone’s in here with a gun and we’re all about to die! Or even WORSE- someone dropped their phone! </p>

<p>Then... we heard laughter. We looked down the steep concrete steps only to be met with the sight of T and other T, two more juniors M and I knew pretty well. They had gotten there late and had been waiting for the perfect opportunity to scare us, and scare us they did. I almost shit my pants. </p>

<p>It’s a funny story to look back on, but BOY were we pissed about it for the rest of the night. </p>

<p>TLDR; My friends in high school were assholes.</p>

This was two years ago and I was at the beach with my whole family. We were there for a couple of hours and everyone on the beach started noticing that there was what seemed like a lot of seagulls deep in the water just sitting there. It eventually got closer and it turned out to be tons of dead fish, and a couple of seals. No one knows how they all died. Me and a couple of my cousins went into the water and there was this red tide. It was some type of ocean plant idfk. The dead fish was at least 10 feet from us and we couldn’t see into the water cause of the plant things. But in the distance, right in middle of all the dead fish, My cousin Nick saw a shark fin. We didn’t believe him so we just stayed but we went a bit closer to shore. Like 5 minutes after a huge shark( I don’t if it would be considered huge cause I never saw a shark before) jumped out of the water eating the fish from below. Now til this day, I don’t dare step foot into any ocean knowing sharks can come out that shallow.</p>

I only ever have nightmares. I will tell you about the worst one, the one that I had. I got almost no sleep and I have a few mental illnesses. There was this one being I used to see a lot, let&#39;s call him ...Ron. Ron followed me everywhere. Not all the monsters I saw in my nightmares were out for me but Ron was. I&#39;d see him from time to time during the day, this was after long amounts of not sleeping well, out of the corner of my eye. Ron was fine during the day but at night he was a monster. I&#39;d watch him open the door and pace around my room. I&#39;d watch him sit there and stare at me, a smile so wide that it stretched his face. He&#39;d just sit there and torture me. So I tried something incredibly crazy (my friends said to try it), I purposely gave myself a nightmare in where I talked to all the other creatures that I dreamt about. They were very sweet, they took me to see Ron in another dimension. There I confronted him I sick and tired of his shit. I yelled I have no idea what I said, I have no idea what he said. I just remember seeing him frown, he never frowned. Suddenly we were not at his home we were in my room. I thought he just kicked me out of his home and then a portal opened up. He reached out of it and at me, and I bolted out of my room. This is where dreams mixed with reality. I had actually run out into the hallway. My mom found me, I said Ron was after me, then I fainted. She put me back to bed, I never saw Ron again. I sleep a lot better nowadays. I assume that&#39;s the reason I don&#39;t see him. The shadow people, the other ones, they were also gone. Sleep is really great. I have more stories if anyone wants to hear more.</p>

We wanted some creepy scenery for using our ouija board. Most of us have used an ouija board before and knew the rules. Rules such as don&#39;t laugh at the spieir, be respectful, one person should talk at a time, etc. 
(I&#39;d like to note that we had spoken to few spirits beforehand). 
After my friend had preformed the speech you must say before meeting the spirit(s), if any, we started to talk to this little kid. He said he had drowned in the river near the park we were in. I don&#39;t exactly remember when the kid said he died, but I&#39;m sure they said they where under ten. 
We talked to the kid some more, and we asked if we could leave(it&#39;s disrespectful to leave without permission). He said no, so we talked some more. A few more questions are asked and answered, we ask to leave again. No. This time we ask why.
D
I
E
We weren&#39;t given permission to leave, so we had to stay with the spirit. I wasn&#39;t leading so I could remove myself if I wanted to, but I was afraid I&#39;d anger the spirit. My hands suddenly felt a lot of pressure and my body was starting to ache(my aching body could have been due to squatting on the ground for a good 7 minutes, but you can&#39;t be toooo sure). We ask to leave again, and got approved. 
Goodbye. 
We finally departed and decided it would be best to wait a bit before returning to the ouija board. My friends wanted to talk to a few more spirits, but I was done for the night. </p>

<p>TL/DR: ouija board scary sometimes</p>

Her bed was lofted (like a bunk bed, but without a bottom bunk), and so it had a ladder going up to it. Every time I would get up to go get a drink of water or something in the middle of the night, I always felt watched from under the bed, like there was something there that I couldn&#39;t see.</p>

<p>One night we were having a sleepover and talking about something random, and we suddenly heard this low growl from under the bed. To this day it&#39;s not something I can easily describe. It wasn&#39;t an animal, not a machine, and definitely not human. The only way I can describe it was it sounded like a demon.</p>

<p>Some other creepy stuff happened in her room too, but I won&#39;t go into that here. If I get enough requests maybe I&#39;ll tell another story about it.</p>

<p>This must&#39;ve happened when I was around 6. My mum had a <em>&quot;dream&quot;</em> one night where my older sister had come down the stairs and asked for matches so she could light the candles in her room. My sister was wearing one of her favourite jumpers and a pair of light blue jeans with a hole in one of the knees. She also happened to be wearing stripey rainbow socks. My mum gave her the matches but told her &quot;<em>to be careful&quot;</em>. My sister must&#39;ve left the candles too close to the curtain and the whole house went up in flames and we all died. </p>

<p>My mum woke up, terrified of course but never told anyone about this dream. The next day, my mum felt a sense of deja vu. It was like she had already lived through the day. Then my sister came down the stairs asking for matches so she could light the candles in her bedroom. She was wearing one of her favourite jumpers, a pair of light blue jeans with a hole in one of the knees, and a pair of stripey rainbow socks...</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>It&#39;s safe to say that my mum said &quot;<strong><em>fuck that</em></strong>&quot; so we all lived but she only told us this dream a year ago (I turn 19 this year).</p>

<p>but basically i was rooming w my cousin one night, and my bed was in front of stairs (don’t ask). i woke up some time in the middle of the night and i looked at the stairs, and there were a set of porcelain dolls lined up filling out each step, and there were also candles surrounding them making it easier for me to see them. and then from what i remember, i went back to sleep and remembered it in the morning and got absolute chills. i couldn’t sleep the next night.</p>

<p>this is probably a lot scarier to ppl who have fears of dolls so enjoy that i guess</p>

<p>This shit is gonna be pretty long so prepare yourself</p>

<p>This happened when I was about 6-8, and my family back then lived in this very small house. And in that house, half of our kitchen were literally open to the world. So like no roofs at all, and we used that part of the house to wash dishes and clothes. Why do the house has this part you may think, well I didn&#39;t know either. And the only thing connecting this open area to the indoors is just a rusty metal door and next to that a window.</p>

<p>There&#39;s this thing also in the kitchen this time it&#39;s on the wall. There was a painting in the kitchen wall, only on one side of it and it&#39;s on the main wall in the middle, it looked very rough and definitely very old. I have vague memory of it being a painting of people and some sort of building behind them, I don&#39;t completely remember. But even as a kid I was very curious and didn&#39;t ask anyone for some goddamn reason. Just everything on that house if I see it now seems very off. Even tho it&#39;s just a very small basic home with one bedroom, a bathroom, a half kitchen and a living room.</p>

<p>I have a little sister, she was about a couple months old at that time. But randomly in the middle of the night my mum woke me up and told me to refill her milk bottle. I already know how to do this. Go to the kitchen, get some hot water from the dispenser next to the rusty door, put the milk powder and just head back to the bedroom.</p>

<p>So I went to the kitchen, turn on the lights, and went to the dispenser. I felt very uneasy getting near that metal door, seeing outside through the window next to the door it was only lit from the kitchen lights. So it all went normal, until I saw a shadow from the window. It looked like a man, wearing a baseball cap. That&#39;s literally the only thing I remember vividly. I was definitely spooked, so I ran out back to the bedroom.</p>

<p>Mum didn&#39;t believe what I said, ofcourse. I just went back to sleep leaving that damn bottled milk alone.</p>

<p>These things didn&#39;t happen just once. We actually had multiple experience in that house. I will not tell them all, but I will if anyone is interested. This one happened to my mum. Kinda short honestly but still creeps me out</p>

<p>It&#39;s at night again, my uncle was visiting. My mum were going to the bathroom to have number 1. When she opened the door she told me that she literally felt like someone was looking at her as she was starting to open the door. She called for my uncle, thinking that it was him. But he was actually outside answering some call, and when he came to her, he said he wasn&#39;t even in the bathroom obviously. My mum was still very skeptical, so she opened the door further. No one was even there. And my dad wasn&#39;t even home yet.</p>

<p>SO APPARENTLY, before we moved to that old house. The people who lived there before (and even now, yes someone is living there) and the people in the neighborhood told us that there has been alot of weird instances in there. Ofcourse we weren&#39;t surprised, we have too many sketchy experience in there. But I&#39;m glad we finally moved out.</p>

I saw orbs constantly and always felt like I was being watched. But one day, in the middle of the day, I walked past my parents bedroom and out of the corner of my eye saw a girl sitting on their bed. The image is still burned in my head and I can still see it clear as day today, almost 15 years later. She was crouched over clutching her knees and had her head tucked down, like she was crying. She had long, wavy hair and was wearing a nightgown. This wouldn’t be that scary, except for the fact that she was completely red. Her skin, her clothes, her hair, everything was bright, blood red. I froze for a second and then turned to look at her when she suddenly disappeared. But something in me knew that if I had kept her in my peripheral, she would’ve turned and looked at me. I’m glad I looked.</p>

We&#39;re driving home after picking up the pizza on a pretty much empty road, with trees on either side.  My mother points out some kind of bird flying ahead of us, and as we both look up slightly, we see the entire top part of a tree begin to sway and then break off entirely, falling towards us.  Luckily my mom sped up enough that it landed just behind us but as it fell it took down some telephone wires that came at the car like a whip, leaving scuff marks all over the windshield and roof.  We were fine, but it&#39;s really spooky that it fell for no apparent reason while we drove right under it.  I still flinch a little bit every time we go down that road and see the other half of the tree still standing there.</p>

<p>1) Was about ten, at the time. My mom and I had gone to town to pick up dinner, the road we were on was a straight, south to north stretch of road. On the way home I see this beautiful large bright orange-yellow. Like it&#39;s gorgeous, and I&#39;m mesmerized by it and watch it for about a mile or two just looking behind us at it.... Then I remember telling my mom how pretty is was, and she agreed, which was odd as she was looking forward, but I figured she was seeing it in the rear-view. I then eventually turned back around to look forward grab a fry or two out the bag etc.... And then I noticed the moon is in front of us... Except it wasn&#39;t full... or the blood moon color.</p>

<p>2)This happened maybe four or five years ago... I still try to tell myself it was sleep paralysis, but I&#39;ve had that several times and this was different and I could move if I wanted to, just didn&#39;t want to... So anyway, I tend to sleep on my couch, and happen to be a night owl. So I know it was daylight when this happened, I&#39;ve no idea what woke me up... But I opened my eyes and glanced toward the area near the entrance to my kitchen, and it looked like the area was farther away... And standing by it was someone(?) in a full astronaut suit but the glass was dark and I couldn&#39;t see anyone inside. I closed my eyes and told myself not to move a muscle, and I didn&#39;t and I was terrified to open my eyes again. Not sure how long after but my dad called from work and I had to open my eyes then to answer the phone, and everything was normal.</p>

The way my room was set up, my bed was attached to the same wall I had a closet on, the closet was just far enough away from the door that the door could open properly.</p>

<p>I used to wake up in the middle of the night constantly. I don&#39;t know the exact time. Late enough that my parents were fast asleep. When I would open my eyes, a man would be floating toward me; out from where my closet was. He was cloaked, hooded. I called him The Reaper. </p>

<p>He would whisper my name. Getting louder and louder as he got closer. &quot;Jordan... Jordan... Jordan.&quot; In this awful hiss that would send a chill up my spine. He would get closer the longer than I looked at him. Floating slowly but always whispering. I would clamp my eyes shut and pull my blankets above my head. The whispering would slow down. Eventually it would stop. When I&#39;d open my eyes again, I could see him slowly going back behind the closet. If he caught me looking, the whispering would start again. The night would start over. He would float towards me again. </p>

<p>I started to get smart. I kept my door open while I slept. And The Reaper stopped visiting. But that&#39;s when the other people showed up. I called them the Bad People.</p>

<p>There were two shadows who would stand in my door. Never get closer, but stand and stare. I couldn&#39;t see their eyes but I knew where they were looking. One shadow wore a pink blazer and the other wore an orange jacket with teal sleeves. They would stand there and watch. Not even closing my eyes could keep them away. </p>

<p>I would call my parents because I had woken up. Hoping they could scare the bad people away. Whenever I told my parents about them, my parents would say it was just them checking in on me to make sure I was sleeping. But that never made sense to me. Why would the Bad People be my parents if my parents had to walk from their room when I called? Why did the Bad People disappear when my parents arrived?</p>

<p>I&#39;m 21 now. I grew up. Outgrew nightmares. Mostly. But sometimes I can still hear the whispers of the man I knew as The Reaper in the middle of the night.</p>

I&#39;ll start with my mom&#39;s incident.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of the day, around lunch time. She was home alone, in the bathroom getting ready to meet up with my dad for lunch. Sometimes, her friends would just show up to the house and walk in without knocking. She heard the front door open and slam shut as if somebody came in and she looked into the living room to see if one of her friends had shown up, but nobody was there. The house we lived in at the time was fairly old and the front door was made of solid, heavy wood so when you close it, you have to put a lot of force behind it to make it slam shut hard. She just shrugged it off and kept getting ready. But when she did, she heard what sounded like a little girl say &quot;hello?&quot; Right in the door way of the bathroom. After that, she thoroughly checked the house to make sure she was really alone, and she was. So she shrugged it off and met up with my dad.</p>

<p>On the same day, my sister came home from school and was getting ready to go somewhere with our mom in the bathroom. Mom was in the living room waiting for her. Just as my sister was walking out of the bathroom, she heard a little girl say &quot;hello?&quot; Tight into her ear and froze. She was about to ask mom if she heard that, but mom was already looking at my sister and said &quot;I could hear that all the way over here.&quot; And my sister just said &quot;it was right next to my ear.&quot;</p>

<p>Both of them left the house pretty quickly after that.</p>

<p>I have more stories, but my mom, sister, and my dad seem to be the only ones that had these experiences in that house. I never experienced anything too scary except for one time when I was home alone with my sister. There were certain rooms of the house I couldn&#39;t stand to be alone in. The main one being my sister&#39;s old bedroom because everytime I had to walk past it to go to the bathroom, I felt like I was being watched and she said she would always hear heavy breathing and footsteps around her bed at night. My room and the living room were the only 2 places I wouldn&#39;t feel uncomfortable being in.</p>

We decided to go exploring underneath the bridge. It was very quiet and all we could hear was the water running and locusts(and various other insects). We stood still for a moment and suddenly heard footsteps approaching over us. We all froze. Each footstep grew louder and louder as it hit the pavement. We all stood still until we heard a deep voice (almost like an older man’s) yell “hey!”. My buddy finally decided to shine his flashlight up there and ask who was there. No response. We were scared and confused. When he asked again, still no response. We ran up there to see what the hell was going on, and no one was there. We didn’t hear him walk away, there were no cars around, and no trace of anyone there. We all walked home and every time I drive down that bridge I get chills.</p>

As I turned around to ask her what she said I didn&#39;t see her any where I thought she might have left and I didn&#39;t see her so I looked around and I couldn&#39;t find her but we both have trackers on our phones so I checked if she was even home she wasn&#39;t she was at my grandma&#39;s say I was the only one left in the house.</p>

Our cousins live in the hill towns of our part of the state and aren&#39;t allowed to trick-or-treat on Halloween, so they celebrate it the weekend before. (I don&#39;t know why, I tried to look up an answer and found nothing.) Anyway, it&#39;s about 10pm and we are driving back home, with my sister sound asleep in the back while I&#39;m up front with my mom. With us being in the hill towns there are no street lights, so we only have our headlights to see. In the distance I spot a figure on the side of the road close to the woods. It seems odd, but I think nothing of it and continue talking with my mom. She then looks out the window and says, &quot;What the fuck?&quot;, in a scared and confused tone. Curious I look out the window, and thanks to the headlights, see a person dressed as Pennywise, from It, standing in the lane next to us. They weren&#39;t doing anything except waving, smiling, and holding a red balloon. What really spooked me was it being 2019 and not during the killer clown craze of 2016, but there also weren&#39;t any house around for miles.</p>

There was this wood balcony in the back of the house, that oversaw the cliff/sink hole behind us (the back of the house was on stilts). I noticed the balcony looked brand new and when I looked down there was old wooden planks hidden in the grass below.</p>

<p>Apparently the old balcony had fallen off - with someone on it. Supposedly it had fallen off when the last owner was on it and he fell with it and died. Strange things always happened in that house once we moved in.</p>

<p>At random moments select items would start to vibrate - a picture on the wall, the centerpiece on the table, the glasses in the cabinet - it couldn&#39;t have been an earthquake or tremor, if it was then everything would shake at once.</p>

<p>The basement door would randomly open and shut, and if youre leaving the basement you wouldn&#39;t have to touch the doorknob - the door would just shut behind you.</p>

<p>They say dogs can sense spirits, well every night once we moved in, for seemingly no reason at all, my dogs would start barking and howling (which they had never done before), and every time they woke me up and I glanced at the clock it&#39;d be about 3 am - the devil&#39;s hour.</p>

I thought it was a large spider or something coming to get me so I closed my eyes in hopes that it goes away. I stayed awake all night listening to the sound.</p>

<p>The next morning I found out that it was just my dog taping his tale and his paws on my door in hopes to get in and cuddle with me.</p>

My neighbors across the street are some weird crackheads. They yell in the middle of road at night and are just always yelling and fighting. Cops are also there quite often. So this happened a few weeks ago but it was about 3 in the morning and I was up watching youtube. I was about to go to sleep but then i heard this crash outside on my porch. I have a wraparound porch and one of the metal panels that covers the wood is broken and just sits on the porch. Sometimes when it is windy it will blow around a little bit and make this scraping noise. Also if you climb over the edge of the porch it makes a popping sound. So at like 3 30 am i heard it pop and then a tiny scrape. I can see the porch from my window so I look out and it looks like there is a person crouching on the porch. It was just a black figure but it did look like someone. But it looked really skinny and frail. It scared me so bad I sat on my bad for a minute breathing heavily. I get up and tell my mom I thought I saw someone and she had heard the scrape to, but there was no wind. She called the cops and they just circled but they didn&#39;t find anything. I looked back out and no one was there.</p>

<p>When I was 7-8 years old, I lived in a really shitty apartment where all the rooms were along a single hallway.</p>

<p>Me and my family were at the end of the hallway, which is the living room. My mom had asked me to go grab her glasses in her room which was at the end of the hallway. As I walked down the hallway, I remember hearing skittering of something with claws, like a dog or a cat or something running across the hardwood floor in her room. </p>

<p>I opened the door to her room and turned along the doorway, I was greeted with two pale eyes staring at me. I screamed and ran crying back to the living room.</p>

<p>I was maybe around 10 or 11, and I was staying at my aunts house with my sister and grandma for a week. I was already iffy about the dark, but my sister and grandma had to have the light off (I should mention that it was a full house, and we had to share a room). </p>

<p>Well, I was laying on the air mattress on the floor, my eyes darting around because I couldn’t sleep in pure darkness. I thought, maybe I should get up and get some water. So I tried to get up, but found myself stuck.</p>

<p>I couldn’t move my body, the only thing that could move were my eyes. I saw figures around the room, shaped like solidified shadows. A huge hand was in front of my face, so close it could touch it. I felt the tears running down my face, my heart was pounding. </p>

<p>Then, they all vanished. Like nothing ever happened. Now, I am about to turn 17 and still can’t sleep with the light off, because of the weird things I see in my sleep.</p>

It was around 12am when I heard a loud noise from the basement, like something big had fallen. At first I thought my Dad had gotten home from work because he gets home late and sleeps in the basement. Then I remembered that he had the day off. I decided to check on my Dad to see if he was okay. I went down stairs trying to listen for him. When I got all the way down he was just sleeping like normal. I was confused. How could he still be asleep after that loud noise? Then I got a weird feeling that someone was watching me. I went to go back upstairs when I saw a black figure with red dots for eyes. I stood there starring at it, trying to figure out if it was real. When I made eye contact with it, I started to feel sick. I then ran to the couch next to my dad and hid under extra blankets that were there. Hours later, at about 7-8am, I went back to my room as fast as I could without making any noise. </p>

<p>It was years later until I told my parents what happened, and my mom said it was probably in my head.</p>

<p>One night, I was extremely restless. I rolled on 
to my opposite side, and I see the weak cone like light from the smoke detector. The more I look at the shadow from the space of the light and the wall, I realize it looks much, much darker than usual. I think in my head something along the lines of “Go away prick”, and as I do it feels like someone sat on the edge of he bed, right in front of me. It felt like there was a depression on the edge of my bed. I turned over very quickly and try to ignore it, trying to rationalize that it was just in my head, but all night it felt like it was right there.</p>

<p>Throughout my childhood, plenty of nights I hear footsteps on my carpet, but only when it’s clean, like a spirit avoids the Legos on the floor lol.</p>

<p>My other story:
I heard the screeching of a car outside, like someone hit the brakes. I hear car doors open through the thin insulation, and people whispering something I can’t hear. I hear the neighbor’s gate wiggle and something hit their trash can. I didn’t know until the next day, but some people threw a stolen purse over the fence of my neighbors.</p>

<p>That’s it</p>

A friend and I were talking about our experiences with some creepy shit we have seen throughout the years. The high school I went to was built in the early 1900&#39;s and was the only high school in the city for a long time. A lot of the old male students were sent off to world war 2 and many didn&#39;t come back. There was also a lot of rumors that a student had hung their self in the auditorium. As her and I were talking we saw something moving in the way back of the balcony and stop. We weren&#39;t the only ones who saw it because others in the class started to freak out over it as well. It was pitch black on the balcony so we couldn&#39;t make out whether or not it was a student just messing around but when it stopped it turned to the stage and just stared. After while my teacher got irritated and told us all to go to our spots and stop talking about it. After that day we hadn&#39;t seen anything else but it has stuck with me every since. There also is a tunnel leading from the health room in the high school to somewhere in the middle school down the road. It was a great high school but creepy as hell.</p>

<p>Not super scary and definitely not an actual threat to my life (not even remotely), but still scared the absolute shit out of me when it happened.</p>

<p>One night I was the only one awake in the house, and I had been listening to some <a href="/r/LetsNotMeet" rel="nofollow">r/LetsNotMeet</a> stories (creepy real-life encounters, kinda like today&#39;s video). I decided I was thoroughly freaked out and I should head off to bed. So I got up, turned off the lights, and started towards my room. You know that feeling of being hyper-aware of your surroundings, constantly thinking something is behind you? I was in that mindset, given the content I&#39;d been watching. Now, I&#39;ve felt this way plenty of times before, so of course I just tried to brush it off. That&#39;s when I heard a deafening crash behind me, completely shattering the silence and any remaining thought of security in my mind. I panicked and whirled around, slamming on the kitchen light. I was absolutely convinced someone had broken in, but...no one was there. Shaking, I slowly made my way to the kitchen sink and glanced down. Oh, thank goodness. My mother loves those glass window decorations that are hung on suction cups, and it turned out that one of them had simply lost its suction, fallen off, and landed in the sink. I let out a broken sigh of relief as my body relaxed, cushioned by the knowledge that I&#39;m safe.</p>

<p>Those decorations still fall off once in a while and need to be stuck back on, but never before had it happened at night, and certainly not when I was already anxious and on edge. It&#39;s funny in retrospect, but it was definitely the most terrified I&#39;ve ever been in one single moment.</p>

I wake up to the sound of something walking toward my bed, but I am so scared that I don&#39;t move. It gets closer and closer to me, to the point where it is right next to my ear. I hear it sniff my hair and I can feel it breathe onto my neck. I can smell it. I feel the teeth of a large animal slowly encase my neck, and I jolt awake. My door is closed, there is nothing in my room. It must have been sleep paralysis, or something like it, but I have never had an experience like that in my life or anything similar. The feeling of the creature--whatever it was--sniffing and breathing into my ear was one of the most terrifying things I&#39;ve ever experienced. I&#39;ll never forget the feeling of its teeth on my neck.</p>

I was 13-14 at the time and me and my friend decided to play a stupid card game ritual thing to “summon a spirit”. We were only doing it for fun because we thought obviously nothing was gonna happen. So we set it up and were “playing” it, and I decided to ask if it could give us a sign if a spirit was here. (You place your hand above a bunch of cards that are laid out, and when you feel heat over one that’s the one you flip over and depending on the trump it gives an answer. Example: If you flip over a club, it means no.) The card I flipped over was a diamond, meaning maybe. So we just continued playing since we didn’t know if it would give us a sign. In the middle of the next turn we heard a giant bang behind us and we spun around to see the flag holder I have, had been flung from its original spot to the middle of my hall. We freaked the fuck out and said goodbye. The next day we were sitting in the living room and we heard this weird noise , portal like noise. The TVs in the house were off and nothing could make such a noise like it, and it came from the place we did the ritual. No one else was home and we got scared so we just left the house. I know that sounds fake but trust me it’s true. Ever since that ritual weird shit has been happening to me. But yea, that’s one of the scariest things that has ever happened to me. To this day I still can’t explain that noise... still gives me chills.</p>

But this one isn&#39;t an isolated event: this was a persistent and continuous phenomena that still makes me uneasy today, years later.</p>

<p>Far more often that I feel comfortable chalking up to chance, something turned on the electronics in our home. My fiance at the time and I worked together, so we went to work together and came home together too. One day, after a long day in a call center together, we got home, opened the door, and while I was setting down my bag, the TV turned on.</p>

<p>Now, the remote was on our coffee table, not the couch where my bag sat, but I didn&#39;t think much of it. Coincidence, maybe a faulty remote, and hey I was gunna turn it on anyway. We shrugged it off.</p>

<p>But then it started happening regularly. A few times a month became multiple times a week, to daily sometimes. We came to assume that maybe one of the neighbors had a similar signal or something, but it never changed the channel, or the input. It never turned the TV off. Just on. Always on. And always like it was waiting for us, somehow.</p>

<p>We&#39;d open the door from getting groceries, and it just clicked on. Or my fiance would be on her tablet when I was cooking, and as I brought our food into the living room, suddenly it was tv time, the screen unexpectedly aglow. Sometimes I got up in the night to get some water, and from the kitchen I&#39;d see the living room pop to life with light as the TV came on again, as if to say &quot;come and watch with me.&quot;</p>

<p>One day, a friend brought over his Xbox One so we could play some video games together. He plugged it in and remembered he&#39;d left his controllers in the car. We were heading for the door when the console spun to life. We stopped and stared, both of us, because we were more than ten feet away when it just... happened. He was amused, but I was starting to get creeped out. He had a custom engraved controller of which he was very particular, so when he retrieved it from the car it was (obviously) still powered off, nestled safely in his storage box. And his second controller needed batteries from my stash. So I still have no clue how that Xbox turned on.</p>

<p>Just before we moved the TV started turning on more and more, and even my PS4 started coming on at times. I resolved that I&#39;d have to get the TV repaired, but once we moved, it all stopped. In the 2 years since then, our TV hasn&#39;t unexpectedly powered on once, and no gaming console has, either.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like thinking that someone might&#39;ve been there with us, unseen. But my cat does seem more at peace in our new apartment. And the electronics only power on when I tell them to.</p>

<p>my parents are divorced and my mom got custody of me and my sister, i only see my dad every other weekend and other random things like summer vacation and holidays. at my dads old house we were cleaning out my room, don’t remember why but we were. there was a radio on the ground so we thought, “hey why not, we need some background noise”. as soon as the radio is on we all just kinda stand there as it goes between stations without our involvement. we waited a bit to see if it would stop but it never did. we unplugged it and let it sit. i don’t remember why we didn’t throw it out but when my dad moved out we brought it to the new house. worked like it was brand new. his old house had a bunch of stuff similar like lights going out and such, but this one really sticks with me for how sudden it was.</p>

I was walking down our driveway from the bus (we live in a dense forest) and I stopped by the stream under the driveway as I usually do. Something smelled rotting around me, so I look around until I realize that on a branch of the tree above me there is a beheaded vulture. I was kinda creeped out, but not really surprised since rednecks in my area do crazy shit all the time. But what perplexed me was that it was on top of a tree. How did it get there? I decided to think little of it until two days after some of my friends and I decided to go trekking down one of our trails. We stopped in a clearing that isnt too far in, but we really didnt expect what we saw- a pile of dead birds, stacked in the center, all with their heads gone. I then told the story of a few days earlier to my friends, and we got the hell back to the house. While we were leaving, we saw something fairly large move in a tree, but it was too fast for us to spot exactly what.
When we got back to the house, I relayed the story to my father (he is a wildlife biologist) and he explained that sometimes Great horned Owls kill and take the heads off smaller Raptors in their territory. I never thought great horned owls were that big, but apparently they did this sort of thing sometimes. With that cleared up, We kept noticing dead vultures on the ground, but took little heed until spring, when it suddenly stopped. I guess momma Owl has a head collection to show her babies now.</p>

We decided to spend the few nights we were staying at his and my grandmother&#39;s place (she passed away about 20 years before). The night after the funeral, my mom decided to sleep in her old room where she would sleep when she was younger and I slept in the room adjacent, where I could oversee the hallway leading to her room. Later that night I remember seeing an all white figure in a dress walk past my room, through the hallway, and into my mom&#39;s room. Scared shitless, I stared at the hallway until eventually falling back asleep.</p>

<p>After talking to my mom about the incident, she mentioned that my grandmother was buried in all white, so I like to think it was just my grandma tucking her in for the night :&#39;)</p>

I went to a hotel in Chicago for thanksgiving because I have family there. Me and my family (mom and my sister) stayed in this hotel but they didn’t have that many Channels on the tv so me and my sister were just searching through the channels while my mom was in the shower. Me and my sister were pretty young so this memory is kinda fuzzy but I remember we got to this channel and it was like steam punk clay looking animations but it would switch around to recordings of kids doing stuff or little brain games but all the hosts were creepy asf and I remember the laugh track was always off for some reason and it really freaked me out. 
It’s not really a “scary” story per say but it’s just something that creeped me out as a kid 
I’m still trying to figure out what that show or channel was so if you have ideas let me know</p>

<p>For some background, I have had alot of supernatural experiences. Ive heard footsteps, doors open for no reason, whispers etc, but I&#39;m used to that crap at this point. But what does scare me is when I see things. Here&#39;s a compile of all the things I&#39;ve seen. From the least scary to the most scary.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Woke up one night to a stocky pitch black shadow figure waving in my doorway. I quickly run up to turn on my lights and it vanished. </p></li>
<li><p>I was on the bus going to school one day and there was this man, walking in an orange mask passing by. I turn around to try to catch another glimpse of him but he was gone. (We were on a long road so, there was no way he could have just disappeared that fast)  </p></li>
<li><p>.Woke up one night to a 8 foot tall shadow man looming over my bed. I slowly saw up in my bed to face it, and it dissipated into the floor</p></li>
<li><p>I woke up one night to the feeling I was being watched. I roll over and to my surprise, there was this 4&#39;11, long black hair, (she looked like an old 1900s teacher) staring at me. She didn&#39;t say a word, yet I understood her message. She was disappointed in me. I didn&#39;t think much of it because my brain was too tired to really process what was happening, so I rolled over away from her. A few seconds later, I check to make sure she&#39;s gone, and she isn&#39;t. She&#39;s still standing next to me, disappointed. I quickly rush out of bed to turn on my lights, and she&#39;s finally disappeared at that point. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The reason why I believe these to be supernatural experiences and not sleep paralysis is because I&#39;ve read that you can&#39;t move in sleep paralysis, and I&#39;ve been able to move in all of these situations. Also, I don&#39;t believe it was my imagination because these lasted for a little while, too long in my opinion for my brain to be dreaming while I was awake.

<p>I was like 5 and woke up in the middle of the night I couldnt sleep so I walked out into the hallway. My parents room were in the right and the hallway to the living room on my left. As I started walking towards my parents room I turned around for some weird reason. Behind me a tall dark shadow I assumed it was my dad so I walked closer calling out &quot;dad?&quot; I reached to touch it but I couldnt as if it was bearly out of my reach. I looked through my parents door and saw both of their feet haging off the foot of the bed. I immeadiately bolted into their room and onto the bed, then white skeletons came up from the foot of the bed. It was less scary but I still covered myself with the blanket and eventualy fell asleep woke up the next day thinking it was a break in but everything was normal and untouched.  </p>

<p>Later i realised it was my imagination because of the skeleton part. Still scary tho.</p>

The first one:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>When I was little (I think I was in 4th grade at the time), I used to sleep with my door open. My room was situated in a way that when I laid in bed I had a clear shot of my door. If I didn&#39;t wanna see my door then I would simply roll over and face the wall. There was one night where I had just woken up for no apparent reason. I was lying on my back. I opened my eyes and looked straight at my open door leading to the hallway. I saw a black figure shaped like a man. I remember him being tall and wearing a hat. He didn&#39;t feel threatening. It was odd and I was freaked out at the time. I still think about him..</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>And my second one:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>This was a little more recent, like a 2-3 years ago. My dad had gotten me a toy as a Valentine&#39;s Day gift. It was 2 monkeys that had a little magnet in each of their noses and when you pushed them together they&#39;d make a cartoony kissing sound and say &quot;I love you!&quot;. That toy quickly found its way to the bottom of my a basket in my closet. Early one morning, around 3 am, I was woken up by a muffled kiss and &quot;I love you&quot; coming from my closet. I thought my mind was playing tricks on me so I went back to sleep. I was woken up again, not too long after that, to the same noises. At this point, I was freaked out. That toy would have had to be manually pushed together for those magnets to touch and to be able to make those noises. I slept on the couch for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>That same morning, when my dad was up and around, I had him help me look for the toy. It was buried beneath clothes, other toys, and books. I tried to push the toy together to make the noises but it didn&#39;t work. Those monkeys went straight to the trash.</p>

<p>This happened 2 years ago. I was in Portland to celebrate pride with my friends at this thing called pride prom. (it&#39;s like prom, but gayer.) I was just hanging out alone, when this guy walked up to me He looked to be in his early to mid 20&#39;s and I was 17 at the time. He complemented by elf ears and we started to talk more. I thought all was well and at the end of the night while I was waiting for my mom to pick me and my friend up, he asked if he could get a ride. I thought &#39;sure, why not?&#39; and I also gave him my Facebook. The first red sign was when he retrieved his bag from the front desk of the venue (we weren&#39;t allowed to have bags inside the actual event). And when we were outside, he opened the bag and pulled out a hand ax. For some reason that didn&#39;t worry us at the time. But anyways, he walked off somewhere, my mom came to pick me and my friend up, and we went home without him.</p>

<p>The next day, I get a message from him on Facebook. He tells me that he can try to get me a girlfriend. BUT if it doesn&#39;t work out, I have to go on a date with him. I tried to let him down easily, but he kept insisting and soon started saying things like &#39;Fuck you! You won&#39;t even give a guy a chance!&#39; &#39;You seem like a nice gal, just give me a chance!&#39; Even when I told him I was gay (I&#39;m actually pan, I just wanted to get him off of my back&#39;) he just replied with &#39;You could be bi? Come on! Just give me a chance!&#39; And then I blocked him.</p>

<p>That Monday at school, I told some of my friends about him, and they met him at the prom to. He tried to convince them to breakup with their significant others so they can go out with him instead. I know this isn&#39;t the usual creepy story. But it was terrifying to a 17 year old me.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Guy tried to pick up a girl at a gay prom, brought a weapon to said prom, and tried to make multiple people go out with him.</p>

As a side note I never believed in it I just thought it was a piece of plastic so jokingly I opened it up and started to mess around with it and when nothing happened I just left not thinking much of it. Later that night I was having a bit of trouble sleeping and having a bit of back pain again not thinking much. After of few hours of getting sleep I woke up but at the same time I didn’t? I knew I was awake cause I tried to open my eyes and I tried to move my body but I still couldn’t it felt as if someone was holding down on my chest stoping me from getting up after what felt like forever I bolted up gasping for air and my mom walked in asking what happened and why I was trying to breathe I just said it was a nightmare. Later on I found out I had my first experience of sleep paralysis.
After getting ready and going to school my back started to hurt a bit again the ouija board incident didn’t come into mind for some odd reason I just thought I slept wrong but as the day started to go by my entire body started to hurt my body felt so fragile every time I tried to lift up my arm it would hurt so bad I did my best to not cry out loud in pain. My friends were starting to get concerned but kept telling me the day is almost over and to go home and sleep. After walking home that’s when I reached my break point my grandma saw me and asked what’s wrong cause she knew I wasn’t sick and that’s when I immediately asked her to help me and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I kept holding my head in my hands because my head was hurting it felt as if was a migraine. 
She told me to stand up and I saw her holding this egg. That’s when I thought something serious was happening. In my culture we have this thing te quita el susto, to take awake the shock. It’s used for many reasons what you do is someone rubs an egg all around you while saying a prayer and after they are done they open it up to see if anything is wrong an example is if it’s red that’s when you know that person has a blood clot. But after my grandma was done I just collapsed into my bed and when she opened it I could tell she was freaked out cause inside of the egg was nothing but a little bit of black dust. She then told me to sleep with a rosary and after waking up I felt so much better. She asked if I was messing around with something and I said no just to calm her down and not scare her but ever since then I don’t think I’ll ever play with a ouija board</p>

I usually played by myself as a child, as my only sibling was several years older and didn&#39;t want anything to do with me most of the time. 
One day my mother noticed I was doing quite a bit of babbling while I was alone in my room. She asked me who I was talking to and I replied &quot;Hope&quot; to the shock of my mother. Hope was a little girl who lived down the road from me. She was the same age as me and we would of been friends when we grew up, if Hope hadn&#39;t drowned three days earlier. I never got the chance to meet her and my parents didn&#39;t tell me about the drowning till I was much older. 
I don&#39;t really believe in the supernatural, but this story is very weird. My mom likes to say that Hope was just saying goodbye before she moved on.</p>

At the time I lived with my mother, my maternal grandmother, my younger brother, and our Yorkie Maltese mix, Sadie. It was after midnight and I was home alone with Sadie, due to my mother being on a work trip, my brother was staying the week at his dad&#39;s house, and my grandmother working the graveyard shift, watching those crappy &quot;B List&quot; Sci-Fi&#39;s original scary movies. The way our living room was set up the tv was in the corner of the room so I had my back to the rest of the house with Sadie snoring sound asleep right next to me. All of a sudden I hear this HUGE crashing sound coming from our hallway that leads to the rest of the house and all the rooms. At the exact second of the sound, this little Yorkie Maltese mix awakens from her slumber and sprints to what sounds like the end of the hallway barking like she was ready for a fight. It sounded like she had made it to the end of the hallway and she stayed there for what seemed like hours (it was probably only a minute or two) growling like she was trying to scare something off. After this minute or so she stopped growling, and I sat there in silence staring at the hallway thinking the worst for about 30 seconds before I heard the sound of little nails against the wood floor coming from the end of the hallway really slowly towards me. I was stricken with fear and was unable to move, feeling absolutely paralyzed at what was going to come around that corner. What appeared around the corner was Sadie she trotted towards me, laid down, and then immediately passed out as if nothing had happened. I made my way quickly past the kitchen to grab the biggest knife I could find and peered into the darkness of the hallway. There was nothing, I slowly and shakily reached for the hallway light switch, when the blinding light flicked on there was nothing. All the doors to the bedroomns and bathrooms were closed, the false ceiling panel to the attic was still intact nothing was amiss. At this point still so wary of that sound I made my way back to my dog never taking my eyes off the hallway and sat there for a few hours until I heard my grandmother&#39;s car pull into the driveway after her shift was over. Fearing that whatever had caused that noise might be in one of the rooms I quickly lunged up and did a quick check of all the rooms and the bathroom, to only find nothing, and put away the knife right before she came through the door. She was curious as to why I was still awake this late, and the only thing I could muster was I wanted to see her before I went to bed. When I finally went to bed I had night terrors until I woke up in the afternoon. To this day I hate sleeping in that house and if I&#39;m for whatever reason alone in that house at night I always have this weird feeling crawling down my back like if I&#39;m not really alone.</p>

I was taking my dog out to the backyard. We had this light that would sense movement and light up. When I was nearing it, yet not close enough to actually trigger it, the light lit up, and as I looked to the end of my yard, I noticed someone just standing there. Watching me. He wore a grey hoodie. I knew it was someone because there was nothing that could make a formation similar to a person in that part of the yard. My dog saw it too, yet she didn’t bark. She just stared. I immediately ran inside with her. My parents in a way do not believe my story, but I am positive that I saw someone there.</p>
