Standing in my doorway was this really big black wolf standing upright with scraggly fur and it was uncomfortably thin everywhere. Like body wise and snout wise. It just stared at me until it walked away and I&#39;ve never seen anything like it to this day.<strong>Show less</strong></p>

I have a really scary dream. 
When I was 7/6 I had a terrible dream. I usually had nightmares so the dream was pretty normal till it kindve just.. cut out? And then the scene changed and it was a completely white room, kinda like an old photo. And there was a girl. 
She looked like the grudge with a long Cheshire Cat smile. ( forgot to mention I can do this weird thing where I can just.. wake myself up in dreams without much trouble ) so I start trying to wake myself up. As I’m doing this the girl starts whispering ‘ don’t wake up ‘ over and over again, getting louder and louder till she’s screaming at me. At this point I’m having a panic attack, shaking and willingly myself to wake up. Finally I can feel myself starting to wake up and she just stops, gives me one last smile and just says one last ‘ DONT wake up ‘. I woke up in a cold sweat and In tears. I had to sleep with my parents for at least a week. 
I’ve never met another person with a similar experience and it still makes me wonder even now that I’m 16. :/</p>

<p>Was home alone with my boyfriend in the basement playing around with a Ouija board. Nothing new, we frequently played with it and nothing ever happened. But this time was different. We were about 30 min into messing around asking questions when one of the deer heads mounted onto the wall fell. If you do not know, a deer mount has screw holes with a large opening and a smaller track for the screw to slide into and secure. So in order to remove the deer mount, one must physically lift this 20lb head upwards and then out to remove it. The deer head fell, and directly beneath it was a glass table. The sound alone from a glass table being completely obliterated with glass shards flying was enough to scare the shit out of us. We booked it out of there. The more I thought about it, the more creeped out I got. HOW would that deer mount just &quot;fall off&quot;? It had been there for at least 7 years just fine.....</p>

<p>TLDR: demon lifted deer head mount off the wall and smashed a glass table with it.</p>

<p>Another one is, “When I left the living room I would always here men talking. It was crackly sounding, like a radio.” The day after she first heard it she was watching TV and saw a program about exactly what she had heard.</p>

<p>The last one she will tell me a lot, “I would go to bed after checking the whole house and making sure the wood stove was working good. One morning I woke up and the house was cold. Ice cold. So I went downstairs to check up on the wood stove and it was hanging wide open. All the wood still in there. So I filled it up, and headed back upstairs. There were Cheerios stacked NEATLY on the counter.”</p>

<p>When I was a child (really young, like 4-5), I woke up during the night wihout any reasons. It happened two times, one time I saw a kind of alligator shadow coming out from the wall just above me. Don&#39;t remember what happened next, but I think I screamed and my parents came. The second time, I just saw the shadow of a person next to my bed. It wasn&#39;t moving, and I wasn&#39;t moving too. I think I was thinking that if I didn&#39;t move, he would not hurt me. If I remember, I went back to sleep after some minutes.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>When my mother was a child, her family had a castle. There was a room called &quot;The Angel&#39;s room&quot; because of the angels carved in the wood of the bed that was in. And this room, according to them, was haunted. I have two story of it.</p>

<p>The first, a member of the family went to close all the windows for the night. After he finished, he went back to the living room. But some times later, a cousin come to him and say &quot;You&#39;re lucky, you forgot to close the window of the &quot;Angel&#39;s room, I did it for you.&quot; The guy doesn&#39;t understand because he remember closing it, as it was a kind of a special way to close it. He go back to the window, and it was open again.</p>

<p>The second one. My aunt went to the castle to keep the dog of a cousin who had to leave. When she arrived, she doesn&#39;t see the dog and call him. She hear him barking upstairs, and when she go upstairs, she see him barking to the &quot;Angel&#39;s room&quot; door, and he&#39;s pulling, my aunt thought first that the cousin attached him to the stair railing. But when she approach him, she see that nothing attach him to the railing, and once she touch him, it&#39;s like the &quot;leash&quot; is broken and he can move freely again. She open the door of the room, she see nothing strange, but when she want to enter and call the dog, the dog doesn&#39;t want to enter and stay far away from the door, like he was afraid. That scared my aunt and she didn&#39;t enter further in the room.</p>

I didn&#39;t think much of it so tried to go back to sleep. I can&#39;t seem to sleep so I open my eyes for a second (since I&#39;m very paranoid whenever sleeping) only to see a man standing in the corner of my room with their arms crossed. I presume I&#39;m just seeing things since its a pretty common thing for me so i closr my eyes and rub them a bit for it to dissapear. It doesn&#39;t. I start to think its my stepdad for some reason so I wouldn&#39;t freak out. I can&#39;t get my eyes off him and i&#39;m too scared to turn on the lights, afraid I&#39;d see some horribly molten face or something. I manage to get the courage to get up and I walk to my mother. She comes with me to my room and turns on a lamp. It turns out it was just my notestand and clock placed conveniently to look like to clock is the head etc. Safe to say I moved the note stand to the other side of the room to not get terrified.</p>

At my house we have trails in the yard that lead to mud trails that we like to go riding out there. Both my dad and my two brothers decided that they were going to go on the trails with some friends and I wanted to stay home.(my dad acts like a teenager so he hangs out with teenagers) And for some reason it was just a really strange night, I honestly had no idea why I just had a really bad feeling. I decided to just throw the bad feeling in the back of my head and go to sleep, I like to sleep with my door opened so I have more light and my cats can come and sleep with me, but I remember that both of my cats didn’t join me when I went to bed which they usually sleep with me. I just assumed that they just didn’t want to sleep yet or didn’t want to sleep with me tonight. But I started hearing inhuman like noises from my two older brothers room. Which got me very frightened because i can see my brothers door while I’m in bed, our rooms are literally right across from each other, and I never saw anyone go into my brothers room and never heard the front door open so I slowly got up shaking and grabbed a lil pocket knife I have on my dresser (just Incase) and slowly started walking to my door and quietly closed it then locked it and then quickly while trying to be quiet called my oldest brother and asked if anyone came back to the house and he said no, then he hanged up. And I was starting to cry and started looking for a  way to get out of my room through the window which I wasn’t strong enough to open it they are very hard windows to open. About 20 or 30 idk minutes later my oldest brother called me back saying how he just found out my other older brother got very sick and went back to the house. Which explained that the inhuman noises where my brother brutally throwing up in his room. I calmed down a little bit but was still shaken up and finally laid back down for one of my cats to jump up on my bed scarin’ the crap outta me. Soon my cat started looking directly at the wall behind me for a while causing me to jump and quickly turn around. It was just my wall. I could still hear my brother throwing up that entire night. I finally fell asleep at 12:24 or something at night. Then I woke up In complete panic, I felt as if I would run out of air at any moment I drank a lot of water from a barley even filled warm water bottle from right next to my bed. Every thing was turning grey and I couldn’t stop panicking I kept trying to get up out of my bed but I couldn’t until I did and I slowly went to the pitch black living room tripping on my own feet. I somehow made my way to the light and turned it on. I turned on every single light in the room and in my room and the hallway I got a glass of water that I dropped (it didn’t break) and I turned on the tv in which I accidentally dropped the tv remote on the ground causing all the batteries to fall out and roll all over the ground. I just couldn’t hold anything. My dad who apparently came home sometime when I was a sleep heard all the racket, but in the morning he said that he was so tired he didn’t check. I spent the rest of my night in fear watching movies I had taped, mostly a dog’s purpose, pixels , and zootopia. And I tried texting all of my friends telling them that I probably wouldn’t be going to the 8th grade dance that was the next day and if someone could talk right now. But it was like 3:50 AM every one wanted to be ready for the dance so they all went to bed at a good time. I spent almost an entire year staying up in the living room putting on those three movies until I fell asleep on the couch. I had to go to therapy for a while and I’m still horrified to something that happened a year ago. I at least sleep in my room now, with the help of putting calming oil on my wrist(yeah I had no idea it was a thing until my mom came home seeing me like this) and I take melatonin every night just so I can get some sleep. I ended up having so many scary things happen to me that night and all my fear grew into a panic attack in my sleep which when I woke up I was still in the panic attack. People sometimes say it helps to talk about it to others but it doesn’t help me but it Might just help someone else who’s having problems. I just wanted to share this story with you guys. If you guys do read this I just want to say Your guises videos are actually one of the things I watched at the time to calm me down, and make me laugh. Thank you guys so much.</p>

My friends and family have told me the many strange things I&#39;ve said in my sleep, but this one takes the cake for the most disturbing. When I was 10 we lived in a house that was 100% haunted. No questions. I could write a novel about all the things we experienced, but I&#39;ll save most of it for when Mark and Ethan make a video about ghost stories. But this day in particular was very active for the ghost. Hearing foot steps and running upstairs when everyone and all the pets where down stairs. Hearing a strange dragging sound on the upstairs hallway carpet. Hallway and attic doors opening and closing. We even heard a muffled growl or moan coming from my brothers room(the most active room in the house). Needless to say, we were all scared shitless. Neither me or my step sister wanted to sleep alone that night, so I slept in her room. She was 16 at the time, so she was up into the AMs talking to her boyfriend on the phone. According to her, she told her boyfriend that was was going to the bathroom. And as she was about to leave, I sat up, looked her in the eye and calmly said &quot;Don&#39;t go out there. If you go out there, they&#39;ll kill you.&quot; laid down and went back to sleep.</p>

Our entire apartment complex is very secluded from the city, next to hills, real cozy, and there is a industrial compound right next to us. It wasn’t a big deal ever since they’ve been there for ages. But this one night, i remember laying in my bed, at the verge of sleeping when i see bright yellow light outside my window and i thought “oh must be the neighbors fucking around with their lights, it’s fine” and about 2 minutes later, i hear this loud explosion like sound. Now bear with me, i had an exam the next day, i needed my sleep, so i thought a tree fell down near by. and then another explosion. and another. and each time the sound was louder and closer. so i jumped out of bed, scared shitless and i ran out to the living room to see my parents and my older brother already up and staring outside the front window. And all you could see was a huge patch of fire, with explosions coming around every ten to fifteen minutes. It was terrifying. Didn’t sleep the whole night, just sat there and stared at the fire, mortified. The fire services came before the fire broke out into residential area. Next morning we found out a short circuit caused the unused cars and plenty of gas tanks in the area to explode, causing the fire. No lives were lost, except those of two unfortunate strays. Worst night ever. Exam went great tho</p>

<p>I have two scary stories that I still can&#39;t explain. The first one happend more then once, from the time I was about 6 to about 8 almost everytime I was in bed trying to sleep and I would look att my door I would see a bright blue figure slowly walking to my bed, they would stop at my feet and slowly turn to look at me. Everytime I blinked it got back to my door and started walking to me, so one time I tried to keep my eyes open to see what they wanted. It got to my feet and slowly started to reach for my face, it was almost touching my face when I blinked and it was back at my door, I always closed my eyes as soon as I laid down after that because I did not want to know what would happen if it touched me.</p>

<p>My second scary story only happend twice, I think I was 13 or 14, I had a dream that I could not move and a big black dot was in front of me slowly moving away, nothing really happend in that dream, but when I woke up my depth perception was of. I was no longer in my bed one meter of the floor but 30 meter from the floor and almost couldnt see it. It was like that the whole day, everything was really far away and I had trouble seeing were everything were and all sound was muted, like I was under water. Everytime someone talked it was as if I were under water and someone on the surface was talking. I felt so alone the whole day, like I was the only one in the whole world, or like everyone avoided me.</p>

<p>📷</p>

<p>So i have had quite a few unexplainable things happen in my life, but this event really stands out. I was about 13 or 14, and it was pretty late at night. That day was especially warm, so i didn&#39;t have any fans on in my room like i usually did. I was laying in my bed, facing the window and looking outside. I was just looking at the reflection of some art i had on my wall, trying to fall asleep. everything was pretty normal until something caught my eye. I had a huge pride flag on my wall above my bed, so i could see it in the window. It had started to flap and sway a little. I shot up and turned around to look at it. It was swaying, but it confused the hell out of me. I didn&#39;t have any vents that could have been blowing it, and none of my fans were on. I was really tired, so i just stared at it for a little bit, trying to find any explanation. But then i heard a huge bang outside my window. I can&#39;t remember exactly what it looked like, but a huge almost bat like figure was banging against my window. It looked like it was a giant bat or bird, but it was just all black. It was the darkest black i have ever seen, it was like a void. It had small glowing white eyes. I was frozen and just stared at it as it rammed itself into my window. I finally got up and ran to my dad&#39;s room. It was really late by then, and i expected him to be asleep, but he was up out of his bed looking out of his window. He said he heard a lot of noise from outside and was about to check on me. I was really scared, so he asked if i was okay. I told him what i saw, and ended up sleeping in his room that night. The next morning, there was an ambulance, a firetruck, and a few police officers a few houses down. We still don&#39;t know what happened or what that thing was, but it was TERRIFYING.</p>

<p>I’ve got a story. When I was 15-16 or so, I was trying to sleep since I had school in the morning but I was having a hard time sleeping. It was around one or two in the morning and I was laying on my back, trying to doze off when all of a sudden my eyes shot open, my body went stiff and I had no control over anything except my eyes. I heard a loud BANG come from the kitchen, as if our sliding glass door had been shattered, all I could do was watch as somebody stumbled in, holding a gun toward me. I still couldn’t move and I was horrified that this guy had busted in without alerting either my dog or my parents right next door. The guy held the gun towards me for a few minutes until I heard another BANG and he disappeared. After that point I could move again, so I jumped up and ran out of my room, the sliding glass door was fine, my dog was sleeping by the front door and there was no other sign of a person attempting to break in. I looked out the window and saw somebody I didn’t know smashing bottles on the street that he’d gotten from the garbage across the street before wandering off. I never saw that guy again and needless to say I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.</p>

<p>Back when I was still in high school, senior year so I was about 17~ish. It was bright out, as it was still September so it was still bright and basically still August. I was riding the bus home on the left side in a window seat, looking out at the street while listening to music. And in the center of my vision, I see... something in the middle of an adjacent road. It looked like a person, at least in the basic silhouette. But that&#39;s the extent of its features. It was a black silhouette, standing straight up in the middle of the road, facing the road. Its hands and feet ended in sharp points, and it only appeared briefly before disappearing. I took a double take, wondering what I just saw, but when I saw nothing, I dismissed it and went back to listening.</p>

<p>But it kept happening. It kept appearing in random places. The same silhouette each time, appearing around me in a random place before disappearing.  In a Dave &#39;N Busters, on the side of the road, in window of a restaurant. It appeared there. Creepy, but there would be a significant distance between myself and the silhouette. Closing in on the end of the year and the beginning of the next, however, the amount of appearances of it slowed down and finally ceased. However, the encounter that takes the cake was the one on my 18th birthday. That night, I was watching Jurassic Park for the start of a marathon, and I had sat down in my chair. The chair&#39;s position allows an almost straight view into the front room of the house and the stairs that lead up to the second floor. I felt like I had to go to the bathroom, but once I began to get up, I saw it. The silhouette. Standing right there, on the stairs. And it didn&#39;t disappear. It stayed there for a few seconds, giving me more time to look at it. I made the mistake of blinking, and in the interim, it disappeared. I slept on the couch that night, just so I wouldn&#39;t have to go upstairs to face it.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I have not had any more encounters with it, however, I doubt I have seen the last of it.</p>

The bulb was a completely normal white-ish-yellow, but that night when it turned on, it was that distinctly unnatural florescent blue, like how fire is &quot;natural yellow light,&quot; and things like phone screens are &quot;blue light.&quot; It got brighter and brighter, and the bulb exploded and the lamp fell. I remember clearly the sound of the bulb exploding before the thump of the lamp on the floor, so I know it exploded. I, reasonably enough, screamed as glass went flying around my room and my parents let me sleep on the couch so they could clean my room in the morning, after checking me for glass. My uncle is a retired electrition, so they called him to look at the socket and the lamp and so forth, but he never found anything wrong. </p>

<p>There&#39;s more, but those come to mind.</p>

<p>Freaky.</p>

So this happened to me like last year. I was brushing my teeth in the hallway bathroom (our apartment has three bathrooms, one is in my parents room, the second is in me and my brother&#39;s room and the third is in the hallway). I use the hallway bathroom because there isn&#39;t enough space in the one with me and my brother&#39;s room. So anyway I was brushing my teeth when I looked in the mirror and saw some black thing like a boy go running behind me and into our bedroom. I thought it was just my brother but for some reason I kept looking at the mirror. No one came back. After brushing my teeth I looked into our bedroom and saw the bathroom door was closed meaning someone was inside because the lock to that bathroom was broken and you had to hold it to keep it closed. Seeing that it was closed I walked back into the lounge. My brother was sitting there in the lounge. So were my parents. I still haven&#39;t understood what or who I saw running across the hallway into me and my brother&#39;s bedroom</p>

This happened to me around two years ago. I woke up in the middle of the night with an absolutely dry throat. I felt as if though I was dying of thirst. It was so bad that I couldn&#39;t even get up to drink a glass of water. I lay there on my bed for quite a while just staring at the light falling on one of the cupboards from the hall way.
I had closed my eyes for a little while and when I opened them I saw a silhouette of a man in the doorway. His shadow was formed on the cupboard due to the hallway light. I thought it was my father so I said as loud as I could &quot;water&quot;. My parents would often check on me and my brother during the night and I would sometimes when I was thirsty just say water and they would bring it. The shadow didnt move. I thought perhaps my father didnt hear me so I tried again a little louder than before &quot;water&quot;. I was pretty sure that he had heard me. I said water around 3-4 times and when I had finally given up the shadow moved in the direction of the kitchen. I didnt notice at first but that shadow had a different posture than my father&#39;s. My father would walk with a completely straight back while this shadow was walking with his back a little bent. I either didnt notice at the time or didnt care. I just wanted some water. I lay there for what seemed like forever but noone came back. I dont know how I fell asleep but when I woke up the first thing I did was drink alot of water and then ask my father why he didn&#39;t get me a glass of water. My father looked at me confused and said that he hadn&#39;t got up the entire night. He said he had never come near my bedroom as he had been sleeping all night. This had really creeped me out and for the rest of the winter i made sure to drink water before going to bed so that I didnt wake up in the middle of the night and see that strange man again.</p>

So this is a short thing that happened with me. Around 2-3 years ago one night I was laying in my bed while my brother was sleeping (we both share a bedroom). The air conditoner was on and I was about to go to sleep. We have a large pedestal fan in our bedroom. My eyes were about to close when the fan turned on. I thought that maybe it was one of my parents who had turned it on so I turned on to my stomach so that I could see who had turned it on. I was looking at the switches when all of a sudden the fan turned off. My eyesight isn&#39;t good and I cant see shit without my glasses. Because of that I couldn&#39;t tell whether the switch was flipped or not.
Keep in mind that this pedestal fan had no more functions than on/off and three speed settings. No timer, alarm, automatic on/off whatsoever. I honestly dont know how I went to sleep that night</p>

It was a sleep paralysis moment, but it terrified me so here you go: 
I&#39;ve never slept with my door open, but I remember &quot;waking up&quot; in the middle of the night long after my tv sleep-timer shut off. It was pitch-black since my curtains blocked out any light the streetlamps might have offered. I realized I couldn&#39;t move. Suddenly, from the corner of my eye, I saw my door slowly open horror-movie style and four shadow beings stepped into view. 
Two of them were at the foot of my bed on either corner, the other two stood in front of the desk my tv sat on across the room. In between the two at the end of my bed, I saw another figure rising up. This one was different, its shape formed into another creature entirely.
I can only describe it as a wendigo. It was tall, thin, with stretched and lanky limbs with clawed hands. It had a deer-skull head, sharp points on the end of its antlers. It then began crawling up my legs before I jolted awake violently in panic... my bedroom door was still wide open where the shadows left it, and now I refuse to fall asleep if the door is visably open.</p>

Growing up I’ve always had three monsters and they all did something different. 
      The first one is tall, has greenish-yellow eyes that look like they have never blinked but they needed to( they looked like they glowed) and beak that curves into a smile. He would try to open my eyes and look at them, he has never seen them because if he does he’ll get jealous and want them for himself and rip them out of my head and leave me to die. He always stood next to me on the left side of my bed and he was so huge he hunched over to were he was just inches away from my face. He had very skinny arms and fingers like other-mother from Coraline except with strange looking feathers. The only way to keep him away is to keep my eyes shut.
     The next looks kinda like salad fingers except red like blood and even longer fingers with no joints. He always wanted to reach me and pull me off the bed to cut me up to take my joints. He always peaked over the right side of my bed just staring at me. I never knew how big he was but his arms where uncomfortably long including the long fingers. He is shy and doesn’t like being seen so I just have to look at his bright red eyes that look like they were glowing. It was horrible.
     The last one is the most horrible... I’ve never seen it but it’s there. I don’t know what it wants but it won’t leave me alone. It either looks like a Victorian-day man or a little girl that looked bloody as if it was beaten. It always stood behind doors. It didn’t know how to open one, well that’s what I thought... it once opened the door to a crack but didn’t enter. I immediately woke up to see the door open... I think I’m safe as long as I close the door. 
      They all never appeared at the same time.. but over time they stopped coming and I got somewhat of good rest. Sorry if you got creeped out! It’s just sleep paralysis! I hope... ( I already posted this just decided to add it to the thread!)</p>

I opened my eyes and saw my hallway lights turning on and off repeatedly. My sister was sleeping next to me, and from where the bed was I could see directly into the hallway and where the light switch was. No one was in sight as it flicked on and off. My sister, being the heavy sleeper that she is, and me, being a very shy kid I was afraid to wake her up because I didn’t want her to get mad at me. So, I just turned to my side and fell back to sleep moments later. Still to this day I always feel like there’s someone standing in my hallway and sometimes the feeling will get so strong when I’m home alone that I get anxiety attacks and nothing I do will help, even turning on the lights, closing the door makes it worse and keeping it open doesn’t make it any better. Something about this house has always scared me as a child and I bet if you stayed in this house alone, late at night, you would feel what I’m feeling too.</p>

Apologies, this is rather long. </p>

<p>One night, I was awake at around 1:00 AM, as usual. I’ve never been the greatest sleeper, so I usually end up staying up. It’s a routine and has never effected me too much. It was a night like any other. I had my TV on, like usual, because I can’t sleep in pitch black darkness. </p>

<p>I was getting ready to go to sleep when I heard a couple loud knocks on my window. It wasn’t raining, or hailing, or windy. So I grab my phone and turn on my flashlight to look out the window to see if anything was there. I pulled up my blinds and shined my light, but nothing was there. I stayed up for another half an hour to make sure it didn’t happen again, and after nothing else occurred, I went back to sleep. </p>

<p>The next night, I planned on going to sleep at about midnight unlike the night before. The night went on like any other; I talked with my friends on Discord, looked at Reddit, drew, watched some YouTube, everything was going just as usual. </p>

<p>And then I went to go to sleep for the night. </p>

<p>I had just gotten comfy when I heard the door open. I immediately jolted up because I could see the hallway light wasn’t on and I couldn’t hear either of my parents in the hallway and it startled me. As soon as it opened fully, I saw a big, black, spider-looking object scurry into my room and under my bed. The door closed immediately afterward. </p>

<p>I was obviously extremely scared, so I got up and turned my light on and looked under my bed. Nothing to be found. So I turned my light back off and told myself I was fine. </p>

<p>I got comfy once again. At this point, it was already around 1:00 AM. As soon as I was about to drift off to sleep, I heard a couple loud knocks on my window again. Just like the last night, it wasn’t windy, or raining, or hailing. So I shined my light through the window again. </p>

<p>Nothing to be found.</p>

<p>So I made my way over to my bed again when my TV glitched and froze on a woman opening her mouth. So I turned my light back on and shut off my TV. I waited for around a minute and turned it back on. It reverted to normal, so I turned my light back off. </p>

<p>I went to sleep that night, sweating and nervous. </p>

<p>Nothing like that ever happened to me again.</p>

Apparently when she was pregnant with each of us she would have specific horrifying reoccurring nightmares. She said that she would have them almost every single night until we were born and nothing would make them stop. For my oldest sister she would dream that she would just wake up in the middle of the night and look outside, and the whole world would be on fire and everyone would be dead. The dream would only end when she caught on fire and burned to death. For my brother she dreamed about him biting his way out of her stomach or something. But of course mine is like some sort of fucking Lovecraft horror. When she was pregnant with me, she would dream that she was going to see her real life therapist (which she did) and she would spend hours talking about stuff. But the whole time, she said the therapist’s face was all distorted and deformed like in The Ring, but for some reason she wouldn’t think that it was anything unusual. Then after the therapy, the therapist would tell her that she was felling bad because there was simply a disembodied spirit that was trapped in our basement (we don’t have a basement) and that she should try to communicate with it with a ouija board. And my mom was just like “that sounds normal” and left. So she went into our nonexistent basement alone with a ouija board in the middle of the night, and tried to spark to the spirit, but she would feel like something evil was there and something terrible was gonna happen. The spirt kept being vague about itself until my mom finally demanded to know who it was, and all of a sudden she somehow realized that there was no spirit and it was the therapist communicating through the board. Then all at once, she realized that there was something wrong with his face, and then she would wake up. The night she told my siblings and I about all this was the fucking scariest night of our lives. She was sobbing as she told us and I absolutely do not believe she was just lying. She saw multiple therapists and took sedatives throughout her pregnancies, but she would still have these same dreams almost every night. So this is my only true scary story, hope y’all appreciate.</p>

I was in the day room with my floor mates and we were just talking, a girl named Cynthia who stayed in the room across the hall from me was talking to us about how she woke up in the night to someone cutting off a piece of her hair. We didn’t really pay extreme mind to it because she was severely Schizophrenic. We just talked about other things after the room went silent. At this time I had extremely red hair and when I showered the towels would turn pink from my hair dye. We had roommates and my roommate Anika (she was named after Anakin Skywalker, she was really sweet) said she thought she felt that too. We went to bed that night and I woke up to one of the male nurses named Brenton checking on us like he was supposed to, I talk a lot in my sleep, he thought I was talking to him and came over to my bedside because he thought I was talking to him, or at lease that I was his excuse. I woke up to the sound of my hair being cut, I didn’t open my eyes but I was awake and I knew it was Brenton because he wears the same cologne my dad wears. He was petting my hair saying, “If I had you as mine, I’d make you my Raggedy Ann doll.” I stayed quiet until the morning and talked to the head nurse, she laughed it off. When I was checked out, I watched in horror as Brenton waved at me, and I saw my red hair in his pocket with a blue bow and my name on it. A week later, he was arrested because he was making dolls from the hair he cut off of the girls at the facility, one of the photos taken from the crime scene was the strand of my hair, which had his semen on it. He had over 15,000 dolls made from the hair of the girls. I literally shutter when I see Raggedy Ann dolls now.</p>

but i&#39;ll tell the story anyways:</p>

<p>so when i was still in kindergarten at around age 4 or 5 i really loved to eat that like double nutella thingy of white and dark creme never knowing i was (apparently) &quot;allergic&quot; to something in the white part
one day i started to get big red splotches all over my body that would come and go but i have sensitive skin so my mom wasn&#39;t too concerned and just slapped the usual salve on there and called it a day</p>

<p>but oh boi was it not just sensitive skin</p>

<p>days later and still eating my little toast with the white nutella on it i was straight up hallucinating thinking i was getting eaten by some monster and i started crying and shouting at random walking on my way to kindergarten
my mom thought i must have been posessed or something because i could not realize that nothing was happening to me
i can vividly remember feeling as if something was biting me all over my body and that i was going to die for hours on end even when finally sitting at the doctors&#39;
i would try to take off my clothes, even in public, thinking there was something under there trying to eat me alive
to this day (i am 18 now) i have never ever again eaten anything that resembles this white nutella creme as this was probably the most terrifying thing i had experienced so far
i cannot for the life of me remember what specifically caused this reaction in me but since i stopped eating that nutella nothing similar has ever happened to me and i am glad i won&#39;t have to endure this type of feeling ever again as it still haunts me to this day</p>

I fully believe something is in my closet. I hear whispering, see things in there, and just do not like it’s vibe. I mentioned in another thread about the horrible sleep paralysis I get and how I see it after, but sometimes I see it while trying to sleep and it shows up in my dreams. It called itself “squancho” or something like that. It’s pure white with long black hair and a flat face (no nose, no chin) and covered in black oil. 
It could be just my imagination taking the scariest parts of things I know (like the ring lady which it’s similar to) but oh my god it’s terrifying.</p>

(there was a previous subway going to a different location aka the one he was waiting for.) he misses his subway and starts freaking out. he starts cussing but that didn’t scare me. he starts talking to the other people waiting for their bus (me and my mom included) and starts saying things like “hey lets play a game”, “how about witch doctor, you like it when we play with doctor huh?”, “tear your limbs off one by one”. i thought he might’ve been on a call or something but he had no phone or earbuds. my mom was listening to music so she couldn’t hear anything going on. i decided to text her because i didn’t want to be talking out loud where the man could hear us. she doesn’t believe me at first and doesn’t want to leave the train station but i somehow convince her to let us leave and we make it out alright. to this day my mom still doesn’t believe i heard those things. it still frightens me to this day.</p>

I was walking down our driveway from the bus (we live in a dense forest) and I stopped by the stream under the driveway as I usually do. Something smelled rotting around me, so I look around until I realize that on a branch of the tree above me there is a beheaded vulture. I was kinda creeped out, but not really surprised since rednecks in my area do crazy shit all the time. But what perplexed me was that it was on top of a tree. How did it get there? I decided to think little of it until two days after some of my friends and I decided to go trekking down one of our trails. We stopped in a clearing that isnt too far in, but we really didnt expect what we saw- a pile of dead birds, stacked in the center, all with their heads gone. I then told the story of a few days earlier to my friends, and we got the hell back to the house. While we were leaving, we saw something fairly large move in a tree, but it was too fast for us to spot exactly what.
When we got back to the house, I relayed the story to my father (he is a wildlife biologist) and he explained that sometimes Great horned Owls kill and take the heads off smaller Raptors in their territory. I never thought great horned owls were that big, but apparently they did this sort of thing sometimes. With that cleared up, We kept noticing dead vultures on the ground, but took little heed until spring, when it suddenly stopped. I guess momma Owl has a head collection to show her babies now.</p>

This wasn’t the first experience but was one of the scarier ones. I woke up in the middle of the night and heard the sound of someone walking in the hall outside my bedroom that I shared with my younger sister. Sometimes there would be a man (what I believe was a ghost) that would walk in my room and that was it. He never spoke or did anything else and I never saw his face, just the outline/shadow, and then he would leave. This time was different though. My sister’s bed was across from mine so I looked over and sitting on the edge of her bed was the man. He was leaning over with his elbows on his knees, head in his hands. Slowly, he started to lift his head up, like he was going to look at me. I immediately threw the blankets over my head. A second later, I felt my bed dip down like someone sitting on the edge right next to me and then I heard my name being whispered right by my head. I don’t know how I did it but I jumped up and ran to my parents bedroom and climbed into my mom’s side. She woke up and held me while I cried. After this, I never really experienced anything to this point. Years later when I was talking to my mom about this, she told me that when she was holding me she heard someone whispering in a garbled language in her ear so she just held me tighter until I fell asleep.</p>

<p>I&#39;d just eaten and I decided to stick the telly on, can&#39;t remember what I was watching but suddenly I felt their was a presence in the room like something was watching me, I ignored it for a little while but then one of the cats was staring at one specific part of the living room that gose into the kitchen as if something was there.
Eventually it gets to my breaking point with some of the dishes that were on the counter start to slide around so I get up and slowly make my way to the towards the dark kitchen, I get to arch and look around before turning on the light... nothing, I return to the living room and look out the window next to where I was sitting watching the telly and again... nothing.
After that I went upstairs to my room for the night but the feeling never left me, this is literally the only time I&#39;ve ever felt scared whilse home alone</p>

<p>So my family and I were driving “up north” as people where I’m from would say (basically a woodsy area with cabins and what not), and we were on our way back from dinner, and it was pitch black out. Being in the middle of nowhere there were almost no street lights, and just woods on both sides of the road. My dad turns on his gps device, because my dad is my dad and didn’t use his phone for a gps. It ended up taking too long to set up so my mom just used her phone and we were given a route back to the cabin/resort area. The gps ended up taking us through a back-road type thing with branches in the way, and this was a full on dirt road. Not even gravel or stone, just dirt. We’re driving for about 5 minutes through this wooded path when we came across an abandoned truck. This truck was really run down, and clearly had been there for a while. It had branches sticking out of it and it was just creepy. We hauled ass out of there. The weird thing is that there were no buildings, no houses or cabins, no nothing within five miles of that little road. I don’t know why that truck was there, but it scared the crap out of me.</p>

<p>the funny thing about this is that i never really realized how spooky it was until i told somebody out loud because it happened frequent enough that it never creeped me out so much i couldn&#39;t just go back to sleep, but not like every night.  </p>

<p>it only happened during that very brief window of time as you go from sleeping to awake, as your senses sort of come back to you but you&#39;re not quite fully awake yet either, i would frequently hear someone whispering <em>directly</em> into my ear. i mean as if someone&#39;s lips were a centimeter away kind of close. strangely enough, upon recollection of these experiences, i could never decipher any actual words of what was being said, just the very clear vibrations of someone speaking that close to my ear, and a predictably empty room by the time my eyes would open. the first time it happened, i remember looking around for my mom (it felt so real i thought it was just her trying to wake me up or something), but it kept happening and nobody was ever there.  </p>

<p>i figure it could be my imagination, as people can have a lot of strange experiences in that inbetween state, but it happened so frequently that it never surprised me when it&#39;d happen, kind of like when you have a recurring dream, it just sort becomes a part of your life and you don&#39;t really think to mention it unless it comes up in conversation or something. but the vibrations of someone&#39;s voice that directly into my ear always felt very real. strangely enough, it&#39;s kinda stopped lately and i can&#39;t recall the last time it happened, but i know for a good several years there, it had just become a semi-commonplace experience at night.</p>

I spent the night at my friends house, and I am a frequent pisser not gonna lie, so I usually wake up in the middle of the night to go pee and it was about 3:30am or so; I went to the bathroom as usually, and since I really had to go I didn’t close the door all the way cause I didn’t want to piss myself. So in this bathroom, the mirror takes up pretty much half the wall and when the door is open you can see the hallway through the mirror. So when I was washing my hands, something caught my attention in the hallway and I looked through the mirror. I see a skinny, tall, blonde haired naked woman sprint down the hallway. I didn’t hear footsteps though, and no one in the house looked like this woman. I stood there for a minute trying to process what I just saw and I was just in shock. I ran back to the room and saw my friend sleeping, so it wasn’t her pranking me. I don’t know if I was still tired and my brain made me see shit or if there was a spirit or something.  I don’t understand what happened that day and it still freaks me out.</p>

I worked in a ward that cared for elderly people who had Alzheimer&#39;s or Dementia. I worked the night shift and after all the patient&#39;s are put to bed the hallway lights are turned off, leaving only the nurse&#39;s station lit. I remember that I was reading a magazine (we had a lot of down time when the patient&#39;s were asleep) and was seated at the corner of the nurse&#39;s station where I could see down the hallway out of the corner of my eye. Suddenly, I saw what I thought was a patient walking towards me down the hallway. I couldn&#39;t see who it was but I could see that they were wearing a hospital gown which has a distinct blue and white pattern. Patients  with Alzheimer&#39;s often don&#39;t know where they are when the wake up and will wonder the halls and so I would keep an eye out so I could get up and redirect them back to their room. I assumed that this was the situation so I stood up and stepped into the hall, only to be surprised to see that there was no one there. Confused, I walked the hallway and checked every single room, only to find that every patient was sleeping soundly in their beds. It&#39;s been a few years since then I still think about it and I&#39;m not sure if it was a ghost or a really sneaky patient.</p>

Their home was next to a greenspace, coyote territory. There were lots, you could hear them almost every night.</p>

<p>I was exploring the surrounding neighborhood one day cause my grandparents suggested I go outside.
Boomers, amirite? <em>canned laughter</em>
Except I was pretty antisocial and every neighborhood lil rugrat was out on their bike, being generally unpleasant.</p>

<p>So I put my backpack on and went out past the field the coyotes frequented, to the treeline down the hill. I entered the treeline, looking around at the licorice fern and the pines needles accumulating on the ground. The fallen, rotting logs held so much moss and fungi, I accidentally disturbed some centipedes.</p>

<p>But then I found it. I found a perfectly formed circle of mushrooms. I should have known better, but I foolishly swiped a few.
I pushed forward, following the sound of running water to a trail I&#39;ve never seen before. It was incredibly mossy and my sneakers were soaked, but it was the most beautiful surrounding landscape I&#39;ve ever seen. Sunlight filtered through the trees, the groundcover moss was soaking my pant legs, socks, and shoes. But I never wanted to leave, I even had no desire to look at my phone.
I brought back a few pebbles, couple of herbs I could identify and use, but things got pretty weird when I looked up a found a lump of unmoving feathers on the trail.
I approached it, turned it around, and its head stayed facing toward the ground. I looked at its head, turned it around with the rest of its body. It had some weird skewed feathers atop its head I hadn&#39;t noticed before, that&#39;s when I realized what this was. I found a deceased, great horned owl. A find like this was impeccable, I usually found myself harvesting roadkill possums because I wasn&#39;t loved enough as a child, but this was like finding a gold nugget in a pile of gravel.</p>

<p>By the looks of it, it had been dead for a little over a day. There were fire ants coming out of its nose. One of its eyes was pretty deflated. There was no blood, nothing indicating how it may have died.
At this point I just experienced what I only read about in books, and it wasn&#39;t good. This was how small children are lured to the forest and ultimately, their deaths. In a moment of dehydrated realization, I finally wanted to leave.
I left the owl. I no longer had any desire to preserve its carcass. I buried it among the pine needles and the herbs I picked. The whole time I ran out of these woods, I felt followed. Watched. I looked back frequently, no one was there. It was getting darker out and I wanted to go inside.</p>

<p>I tried going back to the greenspace, only to get caught in a huge thicket for over an hour. Pretty sure I picked up a curse.</p>

I didn&#39;t even know what time it was when I woke up but it was almost pitch black in my room other than the lava lamp light from the far corner of where my bed was. I woke up to the sound of rain but my brain didn&#39;t process that it was raining, I initially thought that someone was in my room. Normally I&#39;d flick the light on and get the hell out of there if was fully conscious but I was not. If I closed my eyes for more than a second I would be fast asleep again so when I heard the sounds of rain I started thinking someone was in my room. I got up and stumbled into the wall, I was hunching over feeling like I was gonna pass out any second. </p>

<p>Now although I know now that it was the rain it doesn&#39;t exactly explain what I saw that night. I would blame it on me being half awake and half asleep but I was so sure something was crawling at the end of my bed when I walking around of it. I wasn&#39;t even scared, I felt so attracted to the sound and the movement that it didn&#39;t matter what it was at that time.</p>

<p>Now this is the part where I don&#39;t recall anything happening and the memory just kinda blurs. I assume after whatever I did I went back to bed and fell asleep sideways. Waking up was a nightmare because I immediately thought about what happened last night and looked around my room for any evidence that someone was in there but frankly my rooms such a mess it always looks like someone broke in. I was really paranoid for the rest of the day but hey everything&#39;s chill now.</p>

I lived in this neighborhood that was pretty nice, so it was fun to bike around with friends. One time, I was on my way back home from being with my friend at the park, and she had already gotten to her house. I was biking and this guy shows up behind me on his bike too. And I didn’t think much of it at that point, it was a nice day out and other people were biking or walking and I just smiled to him, and waved. But something just seemed off. I turned the corner to another street as it was the route I was taking, and he was still behind me. I took some more turns, and even ended up going in a complete circle, and this guy kept on following me. At that point I was pretty creeped out, and ended up biking through the field that was part of the middle school near my house. He seemed to be gone at that point, so I darted back home. Luckily he didn’t follow me there, and I told my dad what had happened. It was a creepy experience for me to go through as a kid.</p>

<p>About a year ago, in my sophomore year of college, my friends and I decided to take a trip to Clinton Road, NJ. Clinton Road is a 10 mile long stretch with no exits in the middle of the woods, and is known as one of the most haunted roads in America. There’s a bunch of articles of what other people have seen there (ghosts, cannibals, strange animals, ghost headlights, even KKK sightings). My friends and I love spooky stuff, so we wanted to check it out. Here’s our experience:</p>

<p>So we get to the road. It’s around midnight. Immediately everyone feels off. The road is very dark, surrounded by trees, and barely any signs of civilization. I’m driving along, just trying to keep a level head. Every now and then, we’d see a car pass. We get about half way through and we see another set of headlights approaching, except this time, we all feel something’s wrong. You can tell they’re driving pretty fast. Next thing you know, I see these headlights swerve into my lane, almost head on crashes into us. I see some object flying through the air towards my car, I hear a loud thud on the top of my car, and then they swerve back into their lane just before we could collide. We all scream. I slam on my brakes, and I catch a glimpse of a white pickup truck as it speeds off behind us. My friends yell at me to keep driving in case it comes back. We’re all shook up, I’m brought to tears. We all had no idea what just happened. We spent the rest of the drive trying to figure out if what we just saw was real. I didn’t remember seeing any drivers or a license plate. It was hard to tell. It all happened so fast. Maybe it was some locals trying to scare us. But who would start a head on car crash just for a prank? After we got to the end of the road with no other issues, I inspected my car and there was no sign of damage, so we went home. Apparently there are other accounts of people seeing haunted trucks on Clinton Road. </p>

<p>Thinking about this story still makes me uneasy. I’ll never look at a white pickup truck the same way.</p>

<p>When I was little I had this dog named Sugar. We always referred to Sugar as &quot;ghost dog&quot; because of the things she would do. She was a beautiful Blue Healer mixed with Australian Shepherd.
My story is, is that she would be laying down, and then once she got up she would go into the hallway. Normal thing for a dog. Well, when she would leave the hallway, she would keep exiting it. What I mean is, when she would leave, a couple of minutes later I would see her leave the hallway again. I never saw her actually enter back into the hallway again, she would just keep leaving and leaving it. Every few minutes I would see her exit the same place. I was quite little at the time maybe 8 years old and I guess the concept of things seeming out of place wasn&#39;t scary to me so I didn&#39;t flip out at it. 
When she passed away an old woman we met (I forgot where) told me and my mom that her breed was considered a spirit dog. When I think about her little signs pop up from nowhere that she&#39;s still with me. I miss her so much but deep in my heart I know that she&#39;s is the spirit realm having a blast.</p>

<p>One of my most terrifying experiences that I can&#39;t explain was when I was little. I woke up in the middle of the night and I went to go sit on the living room sofa. Suddenly a very bright but very focused light appeared in front of me on the wall. At first I thought it was a car driving through the neighborhood, but it started to move in rapid directions. The light then beamed towards the hallway and there I saw an 8 foot tall, solid black figure looking straight at me from my room. It&#39;s face was ever changing, but again it looked like it had no face. It was peaking at me from my doorway and I just sat there terrified. I get the feeling it was either scared or curious of me because of how it was behaving. It kept going in, and out of my room looking at me. I ran to my parents bedroom and I slept there for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>The most &quot;realistic&quot; one is this one.
In the middle of the night my dog Sugar was freaking out about something that was underneath the house. Our bathtub had a little panel that led underneath to the central vents and then to the house. Sugar was barking and freaking out about the panel. My mom heard a lot of noise coming from underneath the house, almost like scratching and heavy, heavy breathing almost. My mom in a panic went to look at the panel and it had been halfway opened. She sealed the thing shut and held a bat with her for the rest of the night. She told the police and the manager of the trailer park, and they just told her to set up a raccoon trap. </p>

<p>What fucking idiots</p>

<p>Anyways, about two years later my mom&#39;s niece said that she had a boyfriend that had this nickname called &quot;possum&quot; because he could enter tiny places. He&#39;s in prison now for various things, but my mom says that it was probably him that tried to enter our vents that night. </p>

<p>Bonus one: I was on the toilet, and the toilet paper just started rolling and rolling. I touched it so it could stop, and as I slowly started to pull away from it, it just started spinning again really fast.</p>

I&#39;ll start off with the more tame one.  </p>

<p>This one was when I was about six or seven. My mom had just put me to bed and she was doing some last minute things around the house, which meant some lights were still on and leaking through my doorway. I can&#39;t sleep until all lights are off so I was just lying there, waiting for her to be done. Then my grandmother came into the doorway, silhouetted by the hallway lights, told me goodnight, watched me for a few minutes, and then left. About thirty seconds later I realize my grandma isn&#39;t even visiting. I get out of bed and go ask my mom if Grandma is here, she just looks at me weird and I just don&#39;t say anything because my mom didn&#39;t believe a lot of my ghost stories.  </p>

<p>Fast forward to Kentucky, where I lived in a room with no windows that was pretty much completely underground, due to the house being built into a hill. It was the only room this sort of thing happened in, but I know I wasn&#39;t making it up. The cats refused to come into the room with me or sleep with me at night. My dog never did either. There were the regular things, scratching in the closet or walls, sounds like someone scratching at the handles of the drawers or the underside of them. I even saw someone small and red-eyed standing in the doorway in broad daylight. </p>

<p>The worst thing though, that left me scarred for years, was the footsteps. Every night, I&#39;d wake up to the red numbers of my alarm clock blinking from 2:59 to 3:00. Then slowly I&#39;d hear a party upstairs, the sort of casual, red cup, stand and talk sort of party I didn&#39;t know about until later. At different times each night, I would hear the front door slam open, and a man step through. He had heavy footsteps that would stop in the entryway. The party would get quiet for a moment, but then slowly start up again, and I would hear the man start walking again. Down the foyer, down the stairs that were right on the other side of my walk. I could hear every single step, count them as he walked slowly around the living to my door, where he would stop. My mother never let us close our doors at night in case of emergencies, but it didn&#39;t matter, because no one would be there. Sometimes he didn&#39;t stop there, though. He&#39;d walk up to the foot of my bed, or right next to my head, and I would <em>never</em> hear him walk away.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know what the witching hour was until much, much later in my life, but for years afterwards I would wake up at 3:00 AM because my body had been trained to for over a year and a half. Once, after it&#39;d gone on for awhile, I was even brave enough to go upstairs and make sure no one was there, that the door was locked and the house empty. Never was a break in. It wasn&#39;t until I was eighteen that my mom told me we&#39;d gotten the house at such a good deal because it&#39;d been foreclosed because it was a meth house. Not sure if someone had been killed there and decided to stick around or what, but I know it affected me for years and it definitely wasn&#39;t a dream.</p>

One day I was at the last floor of my grandma&#39;s house playing, it was very late and I was sleepy so I was loosing a lot so I decided to play one more time and then go to sleep, it was all alright but then I run out of battery in the game and I loosed but when the jumpscare apeared the lights went of except the one that was above me (the room had 4 small lights) i looked at the ceiling and there was a small eye in the bulb and I thought it was a part of the bulb but then it started blinking, the door closed abruptl and a mini robot/animatronic of a hen started walking and making dying chicken noises so I quickly went downstairs but because it was so dark I tripped over and started hearing giggles and steps coming near me, the giggles became laughter and I felt a cold hand in my leg and the lights came back and the first thing I saw was my brother laughing at me because i rolled down the entire staircase.
And that&#39;s why now I&#39;m scared of that game</p>

I always slept with my door cracked back then and I was old enough to where I didn&#39;t have a night light anymore, so the hallway was just pitch black. However, one night I was trying to fall asleep after waking up in the middle of the night. I was on my right side, looking out into where I knew the hallway was when I noticed a pair of bright, off-green eyes (similar to mine/ my dad&#39;s) staring at me. The eyes weren&#39;t glowing, so nothing around them were lit up; it was more like they were reflecting light. The only light source was from the moon outside my closed blinds, yet the pair of eyes were reflecting so much more light than the blinds would let through. I had a feeling that it was my dad, so I called out to him and asked, &quot;Dad?&quot; to no response. I tried again, saying &quot;Dad? Why are you here?&quot; to sill no response. I don&#39;t remember if the eyes moved away or not, but I ended up rolling over onto my other side and falling back asleep. I woke up the next morning and didn&#39;t say anything about it. I didn&#39;t say anything for years because I never realized how strange the event actually was. The only time I told anyone was when I was having one of those late-night, existential conversations with a couple of friends. They just agreed it was strange and then life went on. I don&#39;t know what I saw, or if I saw anything at all since it could&#39;ve just been a very vivid dream (I&#39;ve had plenty, so it&#39;s not out of the question), but I will always have that memory of 2 floating eyes in the crack of my door staring directly at me.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I was on holiday with my dad in Morocco and we were watching TV late at night. We flicked to the news and they were reporting a story that happened right next to my block of flats where I lived back home. They said that a few hours ago there was a shooting, where a two guys were shouting over something outside, I don&#39;t know what, but it got heated and one guy proceeded to pull a gun out and shoot the other in the leg. Immediately I called my mom who lived there. Luckily nothing else happened after that, but it was terrifying for me. The only thing I was thinking about was what if the shooter went further and shot more people, like my mom, and I was sitting there in another country watching it all on the news.</p>

Brushed my teeth, got into comfy clothes and walked to my room. All of a sudden I get chills down my back and my hair was standing straight up, even the hair on my head was up a little. I walked it off thinking I was just cold but something kept me awake. As my parents told me goodnight a feel asleep. Around 3am I woke up to the sounds of my doors slowly opening. I thought it was my mom but as I open my eyes it was something completely different. A ghostly figure that u could see through was floating towards me, no eyes, mouth open, and a crown on its head. It looked angry, very angry. It was coming at me very fast and as it was on top of me, it vanished. I screamed for my parents but they never heard me. As I try to fall back asleep, my doors slowly begin to close.</p>

One afternoon about thirty years ago my grandmother was taking a nap. She often took naps or just rested in her bedroom for an hour or so- my grandmother was not a well woman. But that day she was in that state between waking and sleeping and she started to hear voices. They were discussing something that was about to happen.  One voice wanted to warn her, another just wanted to wake her and one just thought she should know that it was going to be okay. After a few minutes of the arguing she woke up because of screaming outside from the street. A van had fallen on my uncle&#39;s head. My mother (who was the one screaming) had been outside and seen the jack slip on the rock driveway. My uncle luckily survived.  He was in a coma for awhile and had to have intensive brain surgery that went on for hours. 
There were a few other times my grandmother heard those voices but that&#39;s for a different thread.</p>

She never really liked the apartment, said something about it feeling off, nun of the tenants or employees would talk about the apartment. It was the first night I ever spent the night there and in the middle of the night I woke up to my grandmothers closet door slowly sliding open. I heard a women&#39;s voice say &quot;Hello sweetie,&quot; I&#39;ve been raised with manners so I responded to her. I didn&#39;t see anyone in the closet but I sat infront of the open closet and continued to talk with them and always getting a response. My grandmother woke up and asked what I was doing, I told her &quot;I&#39;m talking with the previous owner.&quot; She went pale and snatched me up as fast as she could. My great grandmother didn&#39;t live that far away, so we went there and stayed the rest of the night with her. The next morning my grandmother demanded answers from the manager and we got the truth and even the records. Apparently an old woman lived there and hung herself in the closet just a few weeks after her husband had passed.</p>

So recently maybe about a week ago i was up at like 2:30- 3:00 am to get food. It was completely dark in my house and i just felt off the entire time i was awake and walking around. When i walked out of my bedroom door the guest bedroom door ,which is right behind me, pops open. Now i’ve always had an assumption that the room is haunted because every family member or friend of a family me never that has passed away is in that room. So when i was walking to the kitchen after hearing the door open a wind went under my arm and my whole body just froze and i almost fell over so i immediately turned a light on cause it just made me feel safer and that’s when i saw that every door in the hallway was open. now i was very hungry so i hurried and grabbed a snack and ran back to my room and as i went into my room i looked into the mirror that’s in front of my door and there was a woman’s face behind me peering over my shoulder. now it’s not like this is the only time i’ve ever seen her i know she’s there but she scares me so much. there’s been times where stuff in my closet will randomly fall of shelves and i’ll wake up with scratches on my arm or stomach.  anyways that’s just one story i have a whole lot more so if anyone seeing this is curious i will be glad to tell more.</p>

<p>In my life I have had two very memorable instances of paranormal phenomenon that can not be explained by any means.</p>

<p>The first happened in my childhood home in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania. I&#39;m not 100% sure how old I was at the time, I was young enough to still play with toys once in a while but old enough to be skeptical about such things as the existence of ghosts, so I&#39;m guessing between 7 and 10. I was playing with a weird action figure of a monster I convinced my parents to get me from a yard-sale not long before in this L shaped hallway that lead to my room, my parents room, and a bathroom, with the entrance of this hallway having a sliding door that nobody had touched in ages. I found myself staring at the creepy action figures eyes, noticing for the first time that it had glow in the dark eyes when the sliding door at the entrance of the hallway suddenly SLAMMED SHUT. I was freaked out but I tried my best to hide/bury that fear (just in case this turned out to be a prank or something) and quickly decided to try and pry the door open, only to meet resistance as if someone was holding it shut. The fear started come out a little, tears welling up, when suddenly the resistance was gone and I was able to get the door open easily, only to find that nobody was even remotely close to that door. At the time I blamed the creepy toy and never played with it again, but considering that my grandfather had died in that house only about a year before and he was always the playful type, I&#39;m pretty sure it was him playing one last prank on me, only to stop when he realized he made me cry.</p>

<p>The second happened when I was around 14 or 15 years old. We were all having a family get-together at my Sister&#39;s place. Everyone else was inside, while I decided to go outside and sit on the porch swing for some fresh air. I was only out there for roughly 3 minutes. I was looking directly at those steps and I know nobody was there, and nobody inside was in the room closest to where the porch swing was, so there is no explanation for how I HEARD SOMEONE STOMPING UP THOSE PORCH STEPS, FEELING THE VIBRATIONS THROUGH PORCH&#39;S FLOOR BOARDS. As I felt the final stomp, reaching the porch itself, I quickly got up, got behind the swing, and jumped off the porch over the bushes, running inside through the side entrance. My Sister, who was right there in the kitchen cooking, asked me what was going on and why I came in that way. I figured she wouldn&#39;t believe me, but I told her what had just happened anyway, only for her to not show any sort of reaction at all. Apparently my Sister and her family had countless experiences in that house and firmly believed it to be haunted, my experience was nothing new. It wasn&#39;t much longer after that they finally managed to sell the house (after years of failed attempts to do so) and move elsewhere.</p>

We close well after it gets pitch black outside. I was the only on left in the store, I had a few things left to do before heading home. As I&#39;m finishing everything up out of the corner of my eye I see a tall figure. It spooks me a bit so I do a check of the store, I&#39;m still alone. In the course of half an hour I think I see this figure three more times. At this point, I want to get home as quick as possible. Just as I go to turn of the lights so I can lock up shop, I hear a knocking at the back door. I know no one can get in, I&#39;ve already locked the doors but it freaks me out. I check the security camera and see nothing, but I do hear knocking again. From the back door. The backdoor that I&#39;m looking at from our cameras that shows nothing. I waited around for a while inside before running to my car. I drove off as quickly as possible, heart racing. Still to this day, I still see a tall figure in the store when I&#39;m alone.

Some good, some bad, some in between. Most of them i dont remember; however, there is one that i remember so vividly. It was 2008 and i was 6 years old. My mom had just tucked me into bed and i fell asleep expecting to have a nice wonderful dream. What i had gotten instead was way worse.
When the dream started there was nothing, like a void where nothing existed. I looked around still saw nothing, exept for one man. He was dressed in a black suit and had red skin with white hair and a beard, both of which were long and unkept. Cautiously i walked up to him as he looked down at me as i looked up at him. He gave me a grin, wider than any i had ever seen. He introduced himself as the devil and said he arrived in my dreams as i was selected for something, a program of sorts. He told me when i would die, how i would die, and where i would end up in the afterlife. After which he pat my head softly and with a snap off his fingers, i awoke. I never had that &quot;dream&quot; again. As a 6 year old boy, i didnt fully understand the concept of death; but now everytime i think about it, it terrifies me.</p>

<p>My spoopy thing: For a while now I’ve been able to like feel presences. Like nothing and no one is there physically but I can feel someone around almost 24/7. It gets super spoopy cause I could feel someone or something and then it gets cold and I’ll hear a noise like someone moving around or hitting something and see shadows moving in the corners of my eyes and sometimes in mirrors. A few times they even move around right in front of me but they are more like translucent flowy shapes of people and demons or whatever. This has always scared to hell out of me and I’ve always slept with the lights on but that does not stop them from showing up and taunting me. It gets worse and more frequent around 3-5 am so I try to be sleep before then but that doesn’t always happen yay insomnia lmao. I don’t know what’s wrong or what they are or why they are here but my therapist just said it was my “over active imagination making up things that aren’t there” and too “be at peace with them and just don’t acknowledge them cause they are just living their life” but you know it’s kinda hard because they feel so threatening and sometimes aggressive.  A few times that I did fall asleep I would have a nightmare that one was flying over my sleeping body as if I was standing across the room watching it happen. Then it would fly towards my sleeping body and I would wake up in real life struggling to breathe like something is crushing my lungs from the inside. </p>

<p>A little extra that I didn’t put on the comment:</p>

<p>I think I’m just super paranoid and over thinking this but this is affecting my day to day life. I can barely go in my closet without panicking. When I leave the bathroom and turn off the light I have to quickly slam and lock the door or else I’ll feel like something got through. I have to be Able to see everything all the time so I mainly sleep in the corner of my room ok my bed curled up. I can’t shower with the curtain closed. Or the bathroom door connecting to my room. My closet has to be closed and blocked off with a chair all the time. Lights have to be on all the time even during the day my door has to be closed all the way and I even took the handle off and carry it around so it’s harder for people to get in but I can get out fast.</p>

The house was built in the woods in Des Plaines, Illinois and it is one of the historical houses. It was used as a red cross for the military and at one point was used as a children&#39;s hospital. When my mother used to live there she was pregnant at the time with my older sister. One time as she was sitting in the upstairs living room she would hear children&#39;s laughter and see little kids peeking around the corners like they wanted to play or something. This was only one of the many occurrences that happened at the house. Another time my mother was at the house alone waiting for her husband at the time to come home. She heard keys jingling like her husband was trying to unlock the door, but when she went downstairs to greet him no one was there.</p>

<p>The creepiest incident that occurred there was quite recent, maybe a year or two ago? A family friend came over with his two daughters. The daughters were maybe around 8-10 years old? The two little girls went upstairs while their father stayed on the first floor in the party room. The girls were upstairs for a while but one of them came down to join her father in the party room. The other girl was still upstairs most likely exploring the house. Although a few minutes later she came running down the stairs almost in tears saying there was a stranger upstairs. Apparently she heard someone walking around and she thought it was her sister coming back up the stairs to play with her. What she saw though was the same thing my mother saw years before, a little girl peeking around the corner wanting to play with them.</p>

<p>Every time I went to that house I personally never saw anything but I definitely got a weird feeling like something was watching me and my family. Also on the first floor of the house in the party/conference room, there is a women&#39;s and men&#39;s restroom and I honestly try to avoid the women&#39;s restroom on the first floor at all costs. I&#39;m sure nothing has ever happened in that bathroom but I always get the worst feeling when I go in there. I feel as if someone else is in there with me. I&#39;ve felt that way about that restroom since I was really little. Currently one of my sisters lives in that house with her father, they are the caretakers for the house now. One last really quick creepy fact about the house is that my mother&#39;s ex-husband was able to capture three different coloured orbs in a picture. The picture was taken in the party room of the house. There were two blue and one pink orb.</p>

The thing looked up at him. My grandfather immediately tried to slam the door shut, but the blue thing was faster. It shoved its ghostly head through the closed door and said into my grandfather&#39;s face, &quot;What are YOU doing here?&quot; </p>

<p>My Mother and Father went to go to Germany for reasons I didn&#39;t know at the time. They left me with my Year 7 (Grade 7) teacher for one week before I could join them.</p>

<p>My Teacher who I will not name had two sons and one husband. Her family seemed nice. Her eldest son, Juhan (Fake name obviously) seemed pretty chill. Her husband was quiet and distancing. </p>

<p>The moment my family left the complex an eerie feeling suddenly appeared. How do I explain something like that? It&#39;s really difficult. </p>

<p>Anyway everything was fine for a couple of hours until Juhan pulled me aside into my room and said the weirdest thing to me. </p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t open your eyes at night. Just don&#39;t.&quot; I asked him why? He just said &quot;Wait, but don&#39;t see.&quot; I laughed him off and told him that it was fine. He just looked at me with a worried expression, but I kept laughing it off, telling him he was wrong.</p>

<p>We go to bed that night and I get ready to go to sleep. I don&#39;t remember when it happened, but late at night I heard something. </p>

<p>It sounded like it came from the kitchen. I didn&#39;t open my eyes at all, but I could hear it. It sounded like a dog licking a wet bowl of water. It then stopped and while making licking noises that were becoming more and more dry, it went over to my room. For sometime and I don&#39;t know how I heard this...thing just staring and &quot;lapping&quot; at me.</p>

<p>It left after God knows how long. I couldn&#39;t sleep...I was too scared to sleep. I waited until it left and then just waited until my eyes felt sunlight to open them.</p>

<p>I tried to speak to Juhan about it, but he just ignored my questions when I spoke to him about that. I was confused, but like a kid I put it at the back of my mind and played with him inside of the complex. </p>

<p>Night came again. I fell asleep easily again. I awoke to the noises again. I just kept my eyes closed and repeated the pattern.</p>

<p>This went on for the ENTIRE weeks&#39; night. Then on the last night that I had to stay there I opened my eyes very slightly to see what the hell it was that was making those strange noises.</p>

<p>It was my teacher, my fucking teacher. She was just fucking standing there as the moonlight from my window illuminated her face.</p>

<p>I finally realized just why Juhan told me to never open my eyes at night.</p>

<p>She was licking like a dog and she was just STARING at ME. I closed my eyes, but I think she saw movement. </p>

<p>She came closer towards me and for the first time I heard a whisper come from her that night. </p>

<p>&quot;Is he awake?&quot; </p>

<p>I could smell her awfull breath. It smelled like that horrible baby formula that you feed your baby, I know this cause her youngest son refused to eat it and she showed him that it was good by eating it as well.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how the hell I fell asleep after she finally left, but I must have passed out as Juhan was waking me up and telling me that we have to go.</p>

<p>Her family took me to the airport and wished me goodbye at the airport. That was the last time I saw her.</p>

<p>There that is my story. I wrote it like I remembered it. If there are any questions please ask them and I will try to answer them.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Yall are gonna have to bear with me because I&#39;m not really used to doing this but anyway.</p>

<p>So these stories happened when I was like 12-13, I&#39;ll start with the weird but shorter story. For context both of these stories happened when I was on the way back from my dance classes which are about a half an hour drive away from where I live.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Story 1:</p>

<p>So it was probably about 9:30(pm) and I was exhausted. My dad was driving me home through kind of a back roads area? (Idk) We were driving by a small forest and out of nowhere a extremely tall dark figure ran across the road right in front of the car. I asked my dad &quot;Did you see that?&quot; and he looked at me and said &quot;What???&quot; as it turns out I was just hallucinating. That was a pretty scary experience for me but now that I know I was just hallucinating it isn&#39;t as scary.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Story 2:</p>

<p>This story happened yet again at around 9:30ish when we were driving home. We were back around those woods again and I saw something in the road, I figured I was just hallucinating again until my dad slammed on the brakes. We ended running over what ever it was so my dad stopped the car to get out and investigate. Turns out we just ended up running over a poor porcupine (sorry mister/miss porcupine) Don&#39;t worry though, this story has a good end. After a few minutes of my dad poking the porcupine with his shoe(?) it finally got up and walked back into the woods unharmed. My dad had to wear a different pair of shoes for a while because there were quills in his shoes for days after.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Thank you for (hopefully) reading my stories and I hope everyone who reads this has a great day! :)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always had a feeling that my house was haunted, and I&#39;ve been into ghost stories for as long as I can remember, and there have been a few times where I&#39;ve cought stuff on camera. But this is the first time I&#39;ve actually seen anything with my own eyes. </p>

<p>I was in bed, lights were out, and I was watching YouTube. I decided it was time to sleep so I put my phone down and right as I did, I saw, in my closet (I don&#39;t have doors on it. It&#39;s a really small closet) a tall figure. Really tall, really skinny with piercing white eyes. I was too shocked to close my eyes, so it just stared at me, until I blinked and it went away. It had a very bad energy to it, and to this day I have never seen it again, but I still see shadows and stuff moving in the corner of my eye.</p>

<p>This was like last year or 2 years ago. I live in Jersey and my best friend had moved to PA like a year or 2 before hand. He came down to visit for the night so we went out visited old friends that we used to hang out with and go to the old places we used to hang out at. Of course I knew how to drive and I could&#39;ve but we decided to walk in the dead of night. It was really quiet on the way back to my house when we just hear screaming, it sounded like someone was being murdered and it wasnt the first time this happened to the both of us when doing this late night adventure. We kept walking and thought nothing of it at first and then it happened again but it was still pretty far out. We were pretty close to my house when it started so we werent too concerned with it. As we drew nearer the screams got louder and louder and closer and closer relatively fast but not even a second ago the screams were extremely distant. It got to the point where the screams were on top of us but no one was around to be screaming, at least not visibly. It was a female scream definitely sounded like they were being murdered or something and then we just started running all the way back to my house where we hid for a while until he had to leave a few hours later.</p>

<p>The next morning when I woke up and looked at the news someone was killed that night. Nowhere near us but somewhere in the neighboring towns around the same time we started hearing the loud screaming noises. We never found out what those screams actually were or who was screaming. I havent gone back out at that time of night since that happened. It was probably one of the scariest nights of my life.</p>

<p>Story 2:</p>

<p>I was like four and this was an event of sleep paralysis the doctor called it some type of epilepsy that happened while I was asleep. It was during the halloween season and I had this glowing pumpkin lamp in my room it was kinda cool and I kinda miss the lamp. Anyway, I went to sleep and I woke up at like 3 in the morning or something I dont remember exactly why, but I remember seeing like a shadow sitting at the desk I had in my old room it frightened me so I hid under the blankets and just closed my eyes and peeked out again. This time it was a girl standing there in front of me by my closet. She was all bloodied and I hid again closing my eyes, next time I peeked it was a boy pale as day with a huge kitchen knife raised above my body only now I couldnt move. I closed my eyes tightly and yelled for my parents and when they came in it was over. No idea what the hell happened that night but it happened and it frightened me real bad. (Hoping these make it in the vid if you guys end up making a vid on our stories here)</p>

Well, I didn&#39;t believe her until one night when I was relaxing in my room with two of our cats. I was watching tv when suddenly the cats heads shot up and and their ears flattened against their head. Confused, I muted the tv so I could listen to what they were hearing - Big mistake. All I heard were heavy boots stomping up and down the hallway, and I knew all the doors/windows were locked so someone would&#39;ve had to broken in if they wanted in the house. I&#39;m spammed my roommate telling her to come home immediately. I laid in bed squeezing the life out of the cats (the door knob would jiggle every once in awhile.) until she got there, and even then I wouldn&#39;t come out until she convinced me to unlock my door. To this day, I have no idea who or what was in the house because we walked through the house together - My roommate told me everything was still locked when she got home and there were no signs of breaking and entering..</p>

I’m 24 years now, this was back when I was between the ages of 7 &amp; 10. I lived with my mom, but always went to my dads house on the weekends, &amp; during this time, he had a 3 bedroom apartment with my step moms &amp; 2 steps-sisters. It was a 4 apartment complex altogether housing 4 families, &amp; the one apartment above us belonged to a family that were already long time established friends with my stepmom so we were all family always in eachother houses. At the exact time at which the night terrors started, I don’t remember, but it was for a long period of time, for those 3 years. I slept on the sofa couch in the living room, my dads room was literally right next to it so he always made sure he could hear me. The kitchen was on the other side, so where the couch was positioned, when laying down, you can’t really see it. I used to wake up crying, feeling terrified &amp; claustrophobic, &amp; the only light in the living room would be the glowing light from the Time on our cable box. The time would always be between 2 &amp; 4am. I would cry for my dad, remembering a strong feeling of something towering over me yet watching me from the kitchen. My dad would usually come &amp; I would always just explain to him that I was scared of the dark because that’s what I thought it was. I was a kid. He would lay with me until I knocked back out... Now fast track 6-8 years later. I’m sitting in my dads new House. No longer the apartment, &amp; it’s a regular day with family &amp; we somehow ended up talking about our experiences. Aunts talking about witchcraft, uncles about spirits and ufos, then my dad starts talking about his story. &amp; I was blown away, he explains how one night, in the old apartment, he was up mad late, having his usual milk &amp; cookies. It was around 3am, When, from the kitchen, he saw a tall shadow within the corner of his eye. He assumed it was the boyfriend of my oldest stepsister since he used to spend the nights. He paid no mind, he heard the sounds of someone going through all the utensils, so assumed he was grabbing something out the kitchen. 15 minutes later. My other stepsister, (The younger one) comes from her room &amp; sits next to my dad. My dad claims she looked shook. He persisted to ask what was wrong, but she continued to say she just couldn’t sleep... the next morning, she tells my stepmom that someone walked into her room late at night, laid next to her on her bed &amp; played with her hair. She was so scared she couldn’t move, until she felt the opportunity to get up &amp; walk out the room. Then, my dad asked the eldest if the boyfriend was staying over the previous night &amp; she said no. Then my dad got mad because he knew he saw something in the night &amp; could’ve possibly done something about it, God forbid there was an intruder, yknow. My stepmom then goes on to say how her daughter was once scared of something called “the monkey man”... I never got much info on it cuz my stepsister was soo young at the time, she only remembers the fear itself, &amp; that it would watch her sleep. My dad was pissed, because he then put two &amp; two together that I was also feeling scared of that apartment. I really do remember a feeling of being watched, at night in the dark. To the point where I had to scream for my father. Even our friends who lived upstairs, felt things in their home. I only knew about this years later. &amp; when I was told about my dad &amp; sisters combined experience, I was astonished</p>

This happened around when I was 13 / 14 years old ; Now 19.   </p>

<p>The story begins when I was babysitting at my cousins house, I was watching her twin sons overnight while she was out. That night i was given permission to sleep in her daughter&#39;s room since she wasn&#39;t there. Around 11 pm, I was upstairs in the bedroom when one of the twins woke up and started to cry. I went to their room and took care of what was bothering him, making sure he went to the bathroom and all before putting him back to bed. Once everything was taken care of i went to the bathroom myself , and when I got out there was this loud growl downstairs. The family didn&#39;t have a dog, they had a turtle in a tank. The growl sounded like the one of a large dog . I turned on all the lights in the hallway and went to bed in the bedroom with the door slightly open and the lights on.   </p>

<p>The week that pursued the first incident went fairly ok, few mishaps here and there but nothing terrible. The weekend came around, 11 pm hit and I was on my tablet at the time in my bed. My bed faced towards my door, which was wide open [ I wasn&#39;t allowed to close it if I wasn&#39;t sleeping back then ], I felt like something was watching me so i instinctively look up only to see a large black mass / shadow dash into the hallway away from my door. I got up and looked all over the hallway and into the other rooms, there wasn&#39;t anything. My dog at the time was locked in his cage. Whatever was back at the house I was babysitting had followed me home.</p>

Her sister that she shared the room with was at a friend&#39;s house, so we decided to hang out in there. After watching a scary movie and telling a few scary stories of our own, we fell asleep. It was about 3 in the morning when I woke up. I was still in the beginning stage of waking up (and it was dark) so I had my eyes closed. I didn&#39;t realize immediately why I had been stirred this early in the morning until I suddenly felt it. A cold hand, it was very obvious it was the hand of a woman because of the nails and the quiet feminine voice I heard whispering to me; an almost melodic tone to her voice, was brushing my hair out of my face. I was frozen, I had no idea what to do. I made the decision to open my eyes although I still felt the hand on my face and heard her haunting voice. My eyes snapped open and I was horrified to see that no one was there. I didn&#39;t get much sleep for a few days after. 
2) <em>Please don&#39;t @ me for my stupidity in this one lol</em>. I was staying over at my friend&#39;s aunt&#39;s house (not the same friend from the last story) with another friend of mine because the 3 of us, along with my friend&#39;s aunt and mother, were going to King&#39;s Island the next day. It was about 10 or so at night and I was hanging out with my friends in the kitchen. I excused myself to go to the bathroom and as I was washing my hands, I heard frantic (slightly hushed) screaming. Alarmed, I ran to the kitchen and asked what was going on. My friends pointed to the full can of soda on the table and said, &quot;The can moved. It fucking moved across the table&quot; I just laughed as I thought they were messing with me. They assured me they weren&#39;t and that&#39;s when I decided to test the limits. I smiled at them and announced, &quot;If anything IS here, I want you to do something to me. C&#39;mon, don&#39;t be a wimp. Hurt me&quot; My friends stared at me in utter disbelief. I told them it was fine and we went to go to sleep. However, that night I saw something in the corner of the room when I woke up in the middle of the night. I actually passed out because I was so scared. I woke up with my chest hurting and it was hard to breathe. Let&#39;s just say I never taunted anything like that ever again. 
3) <em>This one is not paranormal, it&#39;s just unnerving, also, this is gonna be a long one</em>. A few years ago, on my 14th birthday, I decided to go ghost hunting with my friends in a small town called Wapalo. This town has a large percentage of their small population who happen to be actually insane. You know, country folk who hate outsiders so much that they would physically kick them out. Anyways, most of this area is just woods, which comes with its own scary story: Two hunters decided to go on a hunting trip in the middle of the woods near Wapalo. They had a hunting cabin that they would frequently visit and would spend days hunting there. After not hearing from the men for almost 2 weeks, the wives of the hunters decided to call the police to investigate the area. The police went out to the cabin and what they found, shocked them. It seemed perfectly fine on the outside, the truck the men had taken was parked next to the house and there wasn&#39;t any sign of the cabin being disturbed, but it was a different story on the inside. Although nothing had been particularly messed with, there was rotting food on plates and everything was still there, the men&#39;s clothes, guns, and their cell phones. Unfortunately, the men were never found, but some people believe that it was a family known as the Kellers who kidnapped the men and killed them. As the family were known to perform satanic rituals that involved sacrifices. Now, back to my birthday party. As we were a bunch of risk takers, we went to Wapalo along with my stepdad and brother. We were driving along the road in the woods (this was at night) and our headlights hit something quite peculiar up ahead. Hanging from a tree is a rope. And you guessed it, it was a noose hanging from the tree with a box underneath it. This was in the lawn of a house about 50 yards back and we didn&#39;t want to find out what they used it for so we got out of there as quickly as possible.</p>

We were about 15. We had stayed up late chatting and playing games. Just after turning off the lights and crawling into bed, I hear my friend screaming for me to switch the light back on. I rush and put it on, I see nothing wrong except my friend huddled up on her bed, trying to become part of the wall. So I go to her and try to calm her down. Eventually she is calm enough to tell me that she saw something on top of the cupboard alin the opposite corner of the room. I was sceptical, so she told me to switch off the lights and see for myself. I hesitantly switch off the lights and see this overly large male figure sitting on top of the cupboard with his legs hanging over. He was the darkest shade of black that I have ever seen. Darker than the shadows. We slept with the lights on that night. Thankfully I never saw him again.</p>

I think it was because my dad has this headphone display that was this black head and just a head it was marble or something I think. Now to the actual dream every night in the dream I’d give my dad a hug and after he’d always say he’s coming go hide under your bed so I’d go and hide under my bed he was always so calm when he said it like nothing was going to happen it was so strange. So I’d be hiding under my bed scared because the dream happened every night. My door would slowly open and this huge human looking thing walking towards my bed. It was around 6ft tall and completely black but through out it’s whole body it was as though lava was flowing it had the head of the headphone display and every night it’d grab me from under my bed and it’d drag me out all the way through my house and I’d be screaming and no one would do anything. Certain time it’d grab me and put me in a sack and all I’d see was darkness. I did end up getting over it but it’d feel like it wasn’t a dream every time it felt horrible. I just find that was really strange cause it happened for years every night.</p>

We rented out a cabin for the week and we were getting settled in. I hated renting out the cabins in the city we were in, I’ve never had good experience in them. I never did believe in the paranormal but every time we stayed in this city I would hear voices, see things and people that weren’t their. One night my parents left to cabin to go pick up my friend, I sat in the loft and watch a movie. I must have fell asleep but was awoken to a burning. My arm felt like some stabbed it, I went downstairs to get so Ice when I pulled up my sleeve I saw blood dripping down my arm in three rows. I keep calm a thought I scraped something in my sleep. I stopped the bleeding and went back to bed this time on the couch. I woke up to my mom screaming. I jumped up but felt another burning pain this time on my back I ran to the bathroom and jerked my hoodie off to see my back was covered in blood. I passed out of pure fear. Woke up the next day at a hospital. I recovered fine but my parents took me to a psychic cause they new something did this to me. We were told that I had a connection with the entity that was in the cabin and it wanted me out. She said I needed to see if I was a psychic myself and if that’s what caused it. Years later i have never been back to that city.</p>

I laid back down and tried to breathe cause my heart was pounding, and then suddenly the blanket I was laying under started slowly moving. I froze completely out of fear and the blanket just slowly slid off my body and into the space between my bed and my wall. And then complete silence.

I was trying to go to sleep, I had just finished reading a few chapters of a book. I tried to call my dog to bed but she refused to come into the room. I turn off my bedside lamp and start to doze off, my eyes shot open when i heard a sound that was similar to like somebody dragging their hand across my window (I dont really know how I know that&#39;s what it sounds like it&#39;s just the kind of thing where the only thing you can really think of making this sound is skin against glass) I then heard something pluck on the strings of a guitar I have sitting in the corner of my room. I then heard footsteps both outside and inside my house. The constant pattern of crunching leaves one after another mixed with my floorboards creaking in the same fashion. Needless to say at this point I&#39;m terrified and my first instinct is to jump up and walk to the doorway. Everyone in my house was asleep, I figured that my house is just old and the floorboards and outside leaf crunching are a coincidence. Only one thing is left unexplained at this point, what was plucking the strings of my guitar? My first thought is that it was my sisters cat playing with the strings. I look around my room and can&#39;t find the cat so I go looking and find the cat trying to get to my leftovers from dinner. Strange sounds are one thing but something just doesnt feel right. Occurances like these have continued since then.</p>

The sun had gotten awfully bright, and it had been raining all afternoon. 
I looked up at the sun then got up to go close the curtains. A figure in a white dress caught my attention. 
She looked about the same age as me. She was blonde and incredibly pale. She was sitting on the lawn of the house accross the street. Way out in the open, but she wasn&#39;t wet even though it had been raining...
No kids lived in that house, so it wasn&#39;t her yard to be sitting in. The couple that lived there were friends of my grandfather. I thought it was a reflection so i looked toward their front door to see what it was. I didn&#39;t see anything, but when i looked back to where the girl was sitting she was gone.
We lived in a trailer park, the only way she could have gotten up and walked away was to walk right past my front window, i never saw anything walk past. However that weekend i could singing coming from behind the tree in my yard. I asked my dad if he had heard it, and he said he thought it was me. There wasn&#39;t anything there, and i never heard or saw anything again.</p>

I was woken up in the middle of the night by the sound of an electric toothbrush. I wouldn&#39;t have thought much of it, but it sounded like it was right in front of me as I lay in bed. It started to move back and forth in front of me. I immediately thought that it was my brother who had grabbed my toothbrush and was messing with me because I had slept in. I pretended to still be asleep. I felt the toothbrush press against my lips and turn off. I wasn&#39;t going to let my brother poke me with it again. I swung my hand to slap him and my hand hit nothing. I opened my eyes with a smile to swing again only to see that it was still the middle of the night... and I was alone in my room. The sensations felt so real that I checked my bed for my toothbrush thinking it might be there for some reason, rolling around on the bed. It wasn&#39;t. I checked the time on my phone. It was around 1AM. I tried to forget it and go back to sleep, but what felt like seconds after my head hit the pillow, my ears started to ring. I sat up, wide awake in the pitch black of my room. I was confused. This didn&#39;t seem right. The ringing was the wrong pitch. It was too low. I checked the time. Around 2AM. The ringing starts to fade from ear to ear, and it starts to change. Almost like the sound of thousands of gongs ringing all at once. Back and forth it rang as it changed further. This time to the sound of thousands of screams as demonic sounding laughter filled my head. One laugh rang louder than the rest, deeper than the rest, and more direct than the rest. As if it was laughing at me and my terror. Then it suddenly stopped. I was truly terrified at this point. I had no idea what was happening. I turned on my lamp to try to ground myself in reality. Telling myself it&#39;s all in my head, I layed back down with the lamp still on. A few minutes passed and I decided I would try to go to sleep again, and leave the night behind me. I turned off the lamp, curled up in the corner of my bed, and tried to fall asleep. But the night wasn&#39;t over. It was a small sound, but I heard a squeaking as if someone had put weight on the foot of my bed. As if someone or something had leaned in to look at me. Unmistakably, I hurt the sound of weight shifting onto the bottom of my bed as if whatever was watching me had climbed onto my bed. I told myself repeatedly it was all in my head as i heard more shifting of weight as if someone was crawling hands and feet, low along my bed up to me. My self comforting efforts were ended when I felt it&#39;s hand put weight on my foot, grip it almost angrily, and race up the bed to my head. I jolted up and put my fists up, ready to fight whatever was about to attack me. Nothing came. In the pitch black I could see nothing, but in my mind I knew it was still there. Perhaps surprised by my sudden movement and ready to strike again. I sat there waiting for it to come again for about a minute. I grabbed my phone to shine light on it to see what was on my bed. Nothing. It was 4AM. I was alone in my room.</p>

I was still in college at the time living on my own. I remember going to bed pretty late (around 2am) after having worked on school projects all night. Though it was pitch black when I finally fell asleep, when I returned to what I believed to be &#39;consciousness&#39;, my entire room had been tinted a light grey (seemingly void of any colour). My groggy, sleep deprived mind simply assumed it was morning, though it suddenly struck that I was unable to get out of bed. It felt as though my muscles were trying lift bones that had been fused to the bed, no matter how much I tried to move, I couldn&#39;t. That&#39;s when i saw it...off to the left of my peripheral vision, sitting by the door to my kitchen. It was BIG , had the head of a dog or wolf and a neck which seemed to stretch and trail along the ground like a snake, no body to be seen. It craned over me and stare so intently, as if deciding what piece of me it was going to eat first, drool dripping between its maissive and malformed teeth. However, after only a brief moment of this thing staring at me, it disappeared as quickly as I had noticed it. As if blinking, my room returned to normal and I was once again surrounded by pitch blackness in the dead of night, believing the experience to be over. That&#39;s when I felt the most real and visceral feeling of something clamping around my neck I could&#39;ve ever imagined. I start to panic, thrashing wildly and trying pry off whatever has latched itself around my throat. Suddenly (and almost instinctively) I shoot up out of bed and flick on my bedroom light. Next thing I know, I&#39;m standing in the middle of my room in a cold sweat, with no idea what just happened. I&#39;m not a person who gives credence to the paranormal, but that&#39;s the closest I&#39;ve ever come to believing in demons.</p>

I’ve grown up around it. I could write a whole book about stuff that’s happened but that one that has stuck with me and I tell all the time is kinda related to the conjuring. If you have or haven’t see the conjuring there’s a game that involves clapping and you only get 3 claps to find people. I was probably 7 or 8 when this happened. I had woken up in the middle of the night and was getting out of bed to go to the bathroom. I heard a loud clap from my living room. I kept walking thinking it was my imagination. Then I heard another one. I got spooked and sat back on my bed. When I heard a third clap. I curled up into my blanket and within seconds I hear the sound of someone running up the stairs really fast. I have dogs but i could tell it wasn’t them. I didn’t have a lock on my door at the time so I ended up covering myself up completely and I stayed up all night waiting for something to open my door.</p>

<p>When I was 15 I was home alone one night. My mum was away with her friends, dad was at the pub and my brother was at university at the time. The house was really quiet as I was just sat in my room watching netflix or something. At one point I heard someone try to open the front door, I ignored it thinking it was just my dad coming home. Whoever it was tried again and then started banging on the door. I thought maybe my dad forgot his keys but I looked out the window just to make sure. It was not my dad. There was a black range rover parked outside my house with two men sat inside. I panicked and ran downstairs to grab a knife, hoping they wouldn&#39;t see me through the windows. I ran back upstairs and hid in my parent&#39;s bedroom with the lights off, holding the knife. I was fucking terrified. A bit later they still hadn&#39;t left as the car was still there, but now there was no one in the car. I heard another bang, but it was now coming from the back door. They were in my back garden now. I called my dad but he couldn&#39;t drive home because he&#39;d been drinking. I alternated from looking out the window to hiding wedged between my parent&#39;s bed and the wall, and they stayed for a while. They eventually left before my dad got back but they were there for about half and hour. I&#39;ll never know why they came to my house or what they wanted, but that was probably the most terrifying thing to ever happen to me.</p>

<p>This didn&#39;t happen to me but it happened to my mum. This happened from when she was 16 up to when she was in her late 20&#39;s. Every night for years at a time my mum would have these dreams, or what she thought were dreams. The first time it happened, in her dream, her bedroom filled with all these men. They were all slightly different but very similar. They wore similar clothes, long, dark coats and they all wore hats. There must have been more than 20 men crammed in to her small bedroom once they had all entered. After the first time, only one man would enter each time she had the dream. Over the years they gradually got closer and closer to her. They went from standing at the end of her bed, to sitting on the edge of the bed, to lying in the bed with her. This carried on for years, even when she moved to Tokyo and then to New York. Eventually, the men stopped appearing. It was as if all the men in the first dream would come every night individually until they had all been once. Very strange. She says they were dreams but there&#39;s always the uncomfortable possibility that she was awake when she saw them.</p>

<p>When I was young (around 11 - 13) I had a lot of night terrors, nightmares, and experiences with sleep paralysis. This all started when I had my first lucid dream around 11 years old. In this dream I had gone to a summer camp with my friends and stolen some gem or something (i dont remember the details very much) but I remember that some camp councilors or something were chasing us when we got back to the city (this is when I realised that I was dreaming) so I tried to make my dream characters self aware and what not, you know normal dream things. And the main guy chasing us had a really weird face, he was just a simple smiley face. It didnt look real at all. I ended up being in another dream where I had to mess with someone and I realized that the person I was messing with was the same one from the last dream so I went into another dream where I was strapped to a table with the other characters in my first dream. The main guys was trying to experiment with us or kill us or something. I woke up with sleep paralysis.</p>

<p>A few months later I had moved on form the dream. I had given this villainous creation of my mind the sir. ButterMouth. Because I wanted to move on and think of it as something funny. I ended up having a dream with sir. ButterMouth and once again I woke up with sleep paralysis. This happens every once and a while I and it&#39;s not really an experience as much as my subconciouse mind torturing myself but it still used to creep me out.</p>

I had this memory from November 2013 I was a sophomore in high school top of my class cheerleader lived a white picket fence kinda life  (irl in 2013 I was in elementary) I was watching this kid while her mom was going on a date or going out with friends. we turned on a movie and she played with one of those dress up Elsa heads, she was maybe 8,  I took her to the park down the road, it started to rain so we went back home by the time we got in the house we noticed someone else was their, tables were thrown over it was a mess, they knew we were there too, they were in the other room my phone was dead and if we left the house we would die, so we ran upstairs in the little girl&#39;s room (it was fully decorated with Disney stuff and Minnie mouse). We heard someone walking up the stairs, so we hid in the closet hoping they wouldn&#39;t find us. I had the girl behind me because if they were going to kill one of us it was going to be me. What felt like hours went by, all of a sudden I see shadows under the door and a blinding light than a gunshot. The girl behind me knew him; he was her father. a week later the news told a completely different story, they said how I had depression and I committed suicide.</p>

<p>As I was working in the office my mother messaged me saying that someone had left &#39;virtual flowers&#39;  on her mother&#39;s gravestone page. Roughly 25 years ago, my grandmother died, devastating my mother and family, and as a genealogist, she took it upon herself to thoroughly document her mother&#39;s passing.</p>

<p>This included making a &#39;virtual gravestone&#39; on the very old website findagrave.com, a website popular in the &quot;grave-stomper&quot; community (people who document and record gravestones). She filled out the page with her mother&#39;s information, and the page sat for many years without activity.</p>

<p>The next bout of page activity was in 2010, when my mother left virtual flowers on the grave and a message saying how much she missed her mother. Several months later, a moderator also left flowers after viewing the page for maintenance reasons.</p>

<p>Last year was the only activity after another 10 years.
On Halloween, someone left virtual flowers for my grandmother. After speaking with my mom, I went to the page myself and saw the virtual flowers left there, by anonymous user. Unlike the previous flowers posted on her page, the icon for these &quot;flowers&quot; were not flowers at all, but a late 90&#39;s gif of a switchboard operator.</p>

<p>My grandmother worked for many years as a switchboard operator...</p>

<p>This was posted on Halloween, by no one in my family, and my grandmother would have been in her late 80&#39;s, meaning most of her relatives and friends are dead, and undoubtedly computer illiterate if living.</p>

<p>Was my grandmother giving us a sign? Was she trying to contact us on All Hallow&#39;s Eve?</p>

<p>My family experiences many, many, &quot;coincidences&quot; that often lead to larger events or revelations, some hard to explain away.</p>

<p>My grandmother&#39;s last name was Blood. There are several Blood family gravestones in Salem, Massachusetts from when they came to the new world. Perhaps it was someone curious in the occult, placing an inconsiderate message on a Blood family gravestone page as a way to &quot;touch&quot; a grave all the way in Missouri?</p>

<p>I still remember the chill I felt as I realized how personal this message from a stranger was. Personal in knowing things about someone who has been dead for decades.</p>

<p>I have included a screenshot below.

<p>After a long day of college, I&#39;m on my way back home. It normally takes me an hour and a half to get to and from school, and my last bus stop is about a 12 min walk from my house. I usually take the park path way in order to get home faster since it cuts through my block.</p>

<p>Now something to note about this particular walk home from the bus was that it was past 7 pm and the sun was going down. I just hit the pathway that diverges from the street into the park way and I notice a figure at the end of the path on 4 legs. My first thought was that I was looking at a dog off the leash, not an uncommon sight for this path, I&#39;ve seen many people walk their dogs there. Now, I have glasses but their optional and I can only see clearly up to a certain distance. As I get closer to the dog, I can&#39;t help but think maybe this isn&#39;t a regular dog, I don&#39;t see any person around, and the stature of the dog is very large... I approach but with caution, &quot;sometimes dogs just wander off, and maybe it&#39;s missing their owner&quot; I thought to myself.</p>

<p>As I get closer it looks up and notices me, I&#39;m taken aback, this was NOT a regular dog. I pull out my phone and start recording however as soon as I did it started to walk towards me. I&#39;m not sure why I knew to do this but something inside told me to back away slowly towards the road, and to not turn my back on it and run. I start doing this for a couple of seconds, but the dog started to quicken it&#39;s pace towards me, I turn and record the dog following me as I speed walk away from it towards the road. My video was unable to capture the dog since I was frantically walking and trying to keep my distance /which, I know is very convenient/.</p>

<p>Luckily, I was able to reach the road and the dog moved down towards the road side, but before it left I was able to finally see what it was up close. This is a long skinny legged, blond, fluffy tailed Coyote. I live in the suburbs of an industrial area of Ontario, Coyote&#39;s are a very rare sight, I&#39;d never seen them before in my life. Later when I took the long but safer way home, I looked it up and turns out there had been sightings of Coyote&#39;s for a while, and the city had acknowledge this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m lucky to had made it out unscathed, and doing a bit more research on Coyote&#39;s I&#39;m going to be more prepared for the next one, loud noises, and remaining calm.</p>

I don’t know how exactly to describe this, but I could tell that I was facing out to my room physically, but I was looking at the wall, if that makes sense. I was completely overcome by fear because I just sensed someone behind me, and that was before I felt the hot breath on my neck of someone behind me chanting, “They’re coming. They’re coming. They’re coming.” I began to hear footsteps behind me and my sliding closet door opening. 
I felt a hand touch my shoulder and I think that’s when my subconscious was switched dreams or something, bc the memory just kinda blacks out there.</p>

<p>~Hope you have a nice day!~</p>

A odd-eyed siamese cartoon cat stood on it&#39;s hine legs next to me. I notice that there was perfectly cylindrical holes in the floor with cattail inside them going along the entire floor, it turned out that they were made of metal. The cat standing next to me got excited when it saw a large door at the end of the hallway. It ran down the hallway all the way to the door at the other end and I end up along side him. I&#39;m looking at him as he picks up a paw crying about stepping on a cattail. And out of nowhere, the both of us are on the other side of the door in a deeply dark room; to the point where I could only see it&#39;s eyes. And one other object besides the cats eyes was a morgue funeral table in the middle of the room with a body covered by a white sheet. Thr cat speaks once more saying&quot;it&#39;s so spooky&quot; very slowly as it walks across the room. And as that happens, the body starts to sit up even slower than the cat. And that&#39;s when I woke up scared out of my mind . 
I also got the feeling that it meant someone close to me was going to die. In which I told my parents, at that time the exact line mentioned.</p>

I have dense woods outside my house that I usually take my little cousins for walks through. My parking lot goes right next to my house, a small path connecting it to the front door.</p>

<p>One night, as I was coming home from pet-sitting my sister&#39;s dog, I had an immediate feeling that something was wrong. However, I couldn&#39;t just go back and crash at my sister&#39;s place. She&#39;d think I was a pansy. Anyway, I often get paranoid over the smallest things</p>

<p>As I pulled into my driveway, my breath hitched.</p>

<p>There, behind one of the thinner trees in my backyard, was a man crouched down low, acting like he had a good hiding spot. I remember every stupid detail of his blue varsity jacket.</p>

<p>My head swiveled around, frantically looking between the left and right windows until it finally settled right in the man&#39;s direction. I forced my breathing to slow a bit and tried to think rationally.</p>

<p>My hands fumbled around in my bag before finally grabbing my phone. As I should&#39;ve done earlier, I dialed 911 and shakily held it up to my ear. It rand twice before a woman picked up.</p>

<p><em>&quot;911, what&#39;s your emergency?&quot;</em> the lady asked.</p>

<p>Of course, I don&#39;t remember every detail about the conversation, but I told the woman about the man, gave her my address, and she told me the police were on their way.</p>

<p>I talked to her for a little while until I heard sirens in the distance. The man got up from the position he was in and walked away like he was meant to be there.</p>

<p>They never did find him.</p>

<p>This is a really long story so I’ll cut it as short as I can, a few years ago we moved into a new apartment, it was an old Victorian mansion from the 1890’s and we had the whole top floor. Weeks went by and my dad and step mom were finding strange puddles of water and hearing noises and strange smells around the house. 
But, one night as we’re all sat down around the tv watching family guy or something, I get up and go to the dining room which had a door at the end leading to the kitchen where I was going to get a drink. (All the lights are off but the Tv light was still right behind me) something stopped me and I stared into the dark corner of the dining room because  it looked like there were 3 gaping black holes in the air, I stood there longer and a full body of a woman faded into my view. It was just a skull, which explains the three holes, she had shoulder length grey hair and a dark grey gown. After about 15 seconds she faded away and I brushed it off like nothing happened, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. Now that we know the history of the house it’s believed I saw a maid of the original house owners, animals in the house also had their owners worried because they would bark or cry when looking into the dining room corner. </p>

<p>I still live there today and the house has been cleansed though I still feel uneasy whenever walking through the house, like somethings behind me but when I turn around it turns with me. My story is in our towns ghost tour as well so that’s pretty cool. I still have many details and history about the house that I’ve left out to save your time.</p>

We had ordered and were waiting behind another car when my called the bank because she was stressed out about the money she was spending and wanted to see how much was in her account. 

 The call went to an automated message that said it&#39;s normal thing. Something along the line of &#39;press 1 for assistance, press 2 for your current balance.&#39; She pressed 2. Instead of giving her the balance in her account it just repeated itself. &#39;Press 1 for assistance, press 2 for your current balance&#39;.

 She pressed 2 again, a little annoyed. It repeated itself again, however this time after the message of &#39;press 1 for assistance, press 2 for your current balance&#39;  the phone made another noise. It sounded like a deep yet loose and breathy moan from a human. Think of a somewhat ghostly, saddened desperate moan. But it was still very subtle. 

 I thought I was just hearing things and looked over to my mom. I didn&#39;t see a reaction on her face so I thought it was just me. She pressed 2 again. The phone yet again repeated itself. &#39;Press 2 for assistance l, press 2 f--&#39; the phone cut off to moan again. It wasn&#39;t the same recording. It was a different moan. And neither moan sounded robotic or like a glitch. It sounded like a real person on the other end. 

 A little freaked out, me still watching intently, she started rapidly pressing 2 and the phone just started moaning. We didn&#39;t even get the automated message anymore. Just real-sounding human-like vocal moans.

 We both screamed. She threw the phone onto the dashboard after hanging up. I had the chills and was throughly freaked out. We paid for our food, and on the ride home my mom suddenly remembered it was around the time of her grandmother&#39;s birthday/day which she died (I don&#39;t remember which). I got chills again. While at the laundromat we&#39;d been discussing her family all day. Mostly the deceased family members I&#39;d never really gotten to know or have gotten to know. 

 The conversation ceased for a while. We went home and I sat at the table to eat. For the first time that entire year I&#39;d lived in that apartment the picture of my great grandmother was sudden very surreal to me. I felt her eyes burrowing into the back of my head as I sat at the table. When I looked at the picture it didn&#39;t feel like a picture. All of the sudden it felt like she was intensely staring back at me.

 I got freaked out and asked my mom to move the picture. When I asked her to move the picture I referred to her by name which also weirded my mom out as I had never never called &#39;Grandma&#39; followed by her name before. 

 It could have been possible I was just scaring myself but I had never had a problem with that picture before, but all of the sudden I felt as if I couldn&#39;t get away from it. The talk of family earlier that day, the phone call. It was all just so eerie the way it all piled up.

I have really bad insomnia so I never go to sleep before 2am. I get really weird feelings every now and again and the best way to describe it is an overwhelming sense of dread, like if someone is there watching me getting closer and closer but there is no one there. The first time it happened to me I was sitting in my bedroom with my sister listening to music. I was facing my door when the dread came. It felt as though someone was under my bed waiting to reach up and grab me. I had to turn facing my sister and I was scared to move. She had a look of horror across her face as well and I knew she felt it to. We ran out of my room. Years later I moved into my boyfriend&#39;s house (now husband) and we were asleep. I had the worst nightmare, the same feeling came over me as this tall black figure stood at the door then moved to the corner of the room just staring at me. I woke up crying in terror as my boyfriend held me trying to figure out what happened. I calmed down enough and told him what happened and everything was fine from there until we moved into our next place. This time I slept closer to the closet because my boyfriend hates closets. We were asleep when I had the feeling come over me. The tall black figure was standing there watching me. Closer than before but very much there. Terrified I woke up in tears and awoke my boyfriend who comforted me until I could sleep again. The next time it happened we were in our recent place. We were laying down again and of course he was asleep and I was trying to sleep facing away from him but I was having a hard time. I finally dozed off and just as I did I  had the sudden dread and terror feeling come over me. I could feel him standing next to me. This tall black figure just standing there waiting, watching for his moment to strike. I refused to open my eyes. I could see him already. He was in my head telling me to open my eyes but I refused to. I turned to face my boyfriend and started to cry while holding on tight to him. He woke up and held me then turned the light on. I looked around and to my relief it was gone. There was nothing there. It&#39;s been a while since the last time it happened but I do get that feeling every now and then but not to that extent. The worst part is when I realized that he gets closer each time it happens.</p>

<p>it was a Christmas in between 2013 and 2015, when i was in my uncles big ass house (is literally the size of 3 houses), and we (my cousins and i) were shooting fireworks and when we the time of eat cake came, some of my cousins gather in a dark place of the house, and we started to play with some colored lights, we stared with the color blue, and we started to say weird shit with that color, and at some point we stop with the green color and we heard some strange noises in the back of a door (it was a bath room tho) and my cousins got a bit anxious and as &quot;brave&quot; as it sounds i got up and told them to call my uncle, to check the door. when they tried he didn&#39;t answer, my cousins start to tell each other to open the door. so then they called me and told me to open the door and see if there was something in there, i told them about 10 no&#39;s. and finally, i got up and walk slowly to the door and suddenly out of no where the lamp that was on the middle of my cousins, just light up in the color red, we got scared and run to the main hall to the kitchen. the next day my father told me that my grandma died in the room side the door (bath room that i told) and some times her spirit does things and stuff (i got so scared that i didn&#39;t heard all the things he said tho) so now we don&#39;t get close to that part of the house.</p>

Afterwards we hung out at a park. It was around 9-10 pm, it was quite dark, the only light we had were our phones and the distant street lights, we were listening to music, we heard footsteps, so we stopped the music, about a minute later we hear a scream of terror for what we took to be a man, it sounded like he got stabbed or something, then my friends looked at each other and told me how there a noose attached to a tree somewhere at the park, i got kind of spooked, then we hear more foot steps, we get too scared we bolt. We walk through the streets for a bit and then we decide to all go home. The next day I go to that park with my dog, i looked around there was no noose, had it been used?.....</p>

<p>Edit: We we were all 13-14.</p>

<p>I have a story that stopped me from going to a location I used to love going to:</p>

<p>So it was midday, probably around 2pm and me and my cousin had decided to bike down to the lake people always went fishing at. However, this trip, we decided to explore into the woods. We hid our bikes in the bush before we headed on into the dense woods. We were walking and exploring for about 15 to 20 minutes before we stumbled on to a tree. It wasn&#39;t just any tree, however, as this tree had a burnt down tree house on his black branches. My cousin began to wander around and pick up a few items while I desperately asked to leave the site be. I had felt a heavy and dark presence now surrounding us. Something just felt wrong about being there. It had taken me another 5 minutes before I convinced her to leave with me and I left as fast as I could. This lake has a winding dirt pathway surrounded by dense woods and while on our way back onto the dirt roads, we spotted something. This time, my cousin saw this first. It looked to be a little girl in a dirt white dress that looked gray and she had long black hair. We both were both creeped out now so we rushed to leave. When we got home, we told our parents but they didn&#39;t believe us.</p>

<p>A few years later and we are now both in high school, we decided to go back to try and find that tree house. I didn&#39;t want to but my cousin convinced me to. It was much more difficult this time as the woods were now much more dense than they used to be. We explored for almost an hour and we could not find this tree house anywhere. Not even the clearing the tree house was in.</p>

<p>Just as an FYI, there were no properties anywhere near where the tree house was at. Not for miles. So why would there be a tree house next to a lake, so far from any houses in such dense woods? And the tree house was deep in the woods, not close to the gravel next to the dock where people fished.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one from school that terrified everyone in it:</p>

<p>Back in my Junior year oh high school, I was on my way to my health class when all of a sudden, the lockdown alarm goes off and everyone is now rushing into classrooms. I go into my health class and my teacher, Mr. Lougheed, tells everyone to get into the corner of the class as he shut the door. He then lifted up the desks to protect us from any potential gunfire as this lockdown wasn&#39;t a drill... or so we thought. Kids began calling and texting their friends and family, telling them they loved them as they thought they were going to die. Turns out, the lockdown drill button and the actual lockdown buttons are side by side and a student in council pressed the actual lockdown button. The police had been called and everything. No one was in actual danger but we all thought we were going to die. The school had to answer calls and email all the kids parents to let them know of the situation and many kids needed counceling after the incident.</p>

So I wake up and I am thinking &quot;Dang it gotta go back to sleep. I look around my room and I have a chair in the room and I see my passed away grandpa sitting in the chair I am thinking &quot;What in the world.&quot; I blink and he is gone. I lay back down and then the voices of my friends go rushing into my head and I think weird but it will go away jut then they get louder then it starts to drive me nuts. I am pleading for them to stop and I start to cry. So for 30 minutes I am going crazy and crying then it stops ans I fall asleep instantly. I haven&#39;t experienced anything like it since and the weird things is I felt wide awake after it ended.</p>

Basically when I get really stressed out, I have a tendency dream while I&#39;m still awake. Basically my brain kinda tricks itself into thinking I&#39;m asleep and dreaming. So I&#39;ll belive I&#39;m somewhere else and even talk to people like I&#39;m dreaming, even though I&#39;m still awake. Kinda difficult to understand I know.</p>

<p>So throughout my life I would get these weird hallucinations. I know their stress related because typically I&#39;d see myself at work or just in uncomfortable situations. </p>

<p>Anyways, possibly one of the scariest moments I had was back in middle school when I was having one of these moments. I don&#39;t remember everything, it&#39;s pretty fuzzy now, but I just remember waking up around like 2am and seeing someone standing infront of my mirror. It was really odd, cause they didn&#39;t really look like a person. Just some weird shadowy blob infront of my mirror. What freaked me out later on was I could have sworn that I saw their reflection in the mirror. I tried to talk to them, but my eyes started to adjust to the darkness, and they disappeared. Then I just went back to bed.</p>

And where i was had been very close to that. Now into the story .so i was asleep and suddenly i just hear breathing like in the darkest corner of the room. And so i assume its a nurse like getting something for the other patient and so i just go back to sleep. Now like an hour later i hear the breathing again and now it scares me so as nonchalantly as I can i reach for the call nurse button and a minute later theres a like 25 year old male nurse he turns on the lights and we both are in shock i just about fucking scream  because theres a woman in the corner with a scalpel and shes covers in cuts and she looks at us and smiles and just stands there like shes supposed to be there. So nurse asks her to come out and go back to her room she starts yelling and kicking at him as he tries to take the scalpel. I start yelling for security and finally some one shows up and takes the scalpel then the guard pins her on the ground and escorts her back to her room. TL:DR almost died in a hospital</p>

It was especially terrifying after all the news about these devastating school shootings</p>

<p>During a football game for my highschool I was performing , I was in the band. When suddenly there was nothing but screaming and choas. I though it was the hype fromthe ge when my band teacher and people closer to the crowd started to evacuate us. And I was really confused a game has never stopped halfway. I was asking a friend what was happening who just came back from the bathroom she told me how someone came to the stands with a gun. Honestly, the most shock I have ever felt. It was ten times worst because the dance team started screaming and  running. But turns out it was because the sprinkler system turned on. I think the situation was under control but i didn&#39;t hear any more news about other than I think no one was killed but some were injured.</p>

Then one night I decided to investigate but instead of staying up all night I put up a “trap” that was kinda like a trip wire. When it would get pulled a bell would start ringing (this was to wake me up and see what walked inside my room). The bell went off and I woke up and I saw nothing in my room I grabbed my phone turned the flashlight on and checked everywhere in my room then I got to my closet. The door was locked but the thing is the only way to lock it is from the inside and i never would lock my closet door. Ever since I’ve been waking up before that night I would just guess it was my brother playing a prank on me so I would just go back to sleep but this time I new I wasn’t my brother playing a prank on me but so who or whatever was in my closet would come out I went back to bed. So the thing came out and I got so scared I froze in fear because I couldn’t understand what was in front of me it wasn’t a human I could tell but it was something similar. Then the weirdest thing happened my whole field of view went completely pitch black the i saw it it was a how do I describe this it was a more deformed version of the myth of the moth man. Then I tried to grab my face but I got up and ran from my room as fast as I could. Now me and my family live in another house and we found out that the house we use to live in was burned by the owner after sleepover my there for one night in what used to be my room. But every now and then I get the feeling something is still watching me through my closet at night.</p>

He had to go to work and my brothers were in school so he dropped me off at my great grandmothers house. 
While I was watching cartoons in the living room I started to doze off on the couch. 
I had both my hands under my cheek and closed my eyes. Then I felt someone breathing in my face. 
I was waiting to hear my grandma tell me to get up but instead I felt a gentle squeeze on my hands. I opened my eyes and my grandma was in the kitchen making lunch. 
I brushed it off for a while. 
Later that day one of my grandmas daughters came to visit her, she had brought a camera to take pictures of the house for some reason, I think my grandma was going to move. 
Next to the main door there was a painting of my grandma and her late husband. 
When my aunt takes the picture, the camera tells her someone blinked and the two yellow squares were on my grandpas eyes.</p>

Her side of the family is from Alabama and Florida, and this happened in her house in Alabama. The house was in the middle of nowhere, just woods and fields around. Real rural place. She had a sort of sunroof or something, and it wasn&#39;t uncommon for them to hear or see wild animals. One night, while she was in bed with her sisters, my grandma woke up to the sound of a baby crying. She looked up, and sitting on the sunroof looking down at them was what she said was a panther or looked like a panther, trying to get in at them. When I was a kid, it scared me because a wild animal almost ate my grandma. But thinking about it now, it may have been a puma, and what freaks me out is that I don&#39;t think panthers or pumas sound like that.</p>

The house was big with a old rusty windmill in the back yard as well two creepy sheds. The Windows where high above the ground, so high that not even a 6ft man would be visible and they also came with bars which i thought was unusual at the time. One day it was just me, my sister and my brother in the living room whenever i heard a loud bang coming towards the back door, so i went to check it out. When i got there i couldn&#39;t see anything so i went outside in hopes of finding someone, but no luck. I then went back through the back door and shut it behind me and right beside the door, a man with a hole for a face could be seen looking through the window with his creepy long fingers grasping the bars on the outside, where i just was. i instantly ran to my older sister and told her what i saw but when we got there, the man was gone and the back door was wide open.</p>

On this particular day, my parents had left to the store with my younger brother, my older sister left with some friends, and my older brother was at his girlfriend&#39;s house, so it was just me and my younger sister in the house. I decided it would be nice to watch a movie with my little sister, so I set up my Xbox in the living room, and as I was connecting everything, I hear a whistle coming from down the hall at the front door. It sounded like a whistle my older brother does to alert that he&#39;s coming into the house. So I look over at the door, but no one comes in, and for a split second, I thought I was just hearing things, but then I look back at my little sister, she was looking at the door too! She asked me &quot;did you hear that?&quot; I looked at her, nodded, then after a 3 second pause, we both jumped up, and ran as fast as we could to my moms room. To this day, no one in my family believe me and my sister, and we still don&#39;t know what the caused the whistle</p>

I was 10, and had to get up at 4:00 a.m to get to school everyday. I didn&#39;t like to turn on the lights because it made my eyes hurt, so I just walked to the bathroom to get ready and waited for my parents to get up.</p>

<p>One Tuesday, I got up as always and made my way to the bathroom. I was still a little sleepy, so I leaned a little on the door when I was closing it. Suddenly, I felt a huge thing hitting the door right next to my face and closing it, so I screamed as hard as I could and covered my face with my hands, because I was too scared to try and see what it was.</p>

<p>My family is catholic, so we had a little poster of psalm 91 on the inside of the door. My parents came running to where I was and opened the door, and my dad grabbed me and got me out. I was shaking a lot so my mom came to hold me while my dad entered the bathroom. He came out with the poster in his hands, and there were huge scratch marks on it. Then my mom and I entered the bathroom again and there were marks on the door too.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t exactly remember what happened next, I guess I brushed it off cause it was late for school. It was only like two years ago when we realised something with my mom. She had some kind of encounter on the yard of the house, she remembers seeing something that looked like a bear with huge claws, but it was only for a second. We were talking about this when she remembered that she saw that thing one week prior to what happened to me. We&#39;re not sure, but we think it was the same thing.</p>

<p>I know it sounds like I made it up, but my family has always dealt with this kind of things. So I took the opportunity to post it here.</p>

I was asleep, I slept in a bunk bed, I was in the top bunk. There was a rail to keep me in the bed in case I was to roll in my sleep. The rail had a space between it and the bed frame that held my bed that I can see through. 
I woke up in the middle of the night, seemingly for no reason. But my face was in the space between the rail and my bed. Not something that happens ever this was and still is the first time I woke up like this. It was still pitch black outside as I looked at the curtains, if it was day time and the lights were off light would shine above and slightly through the fabric of the curtains in my room. I did not move my face mostly because I was tired and to lazy to move. 
Then I looked down to my floor, now what I expected to see was a cat maybe some toys or clothes on the floor not put where they should have been. But to my surprise I saw a figure, the figure was short. I’d estimate it at about maybe just below 3 foot. It was wearing all white, and seemingly was brighter than is should have been. Seeing as the lights were off, it stood there looking at my closet. When I was younger I had always thought of my closet to hold something paranormal in it. Not the bogeyman but maybe just a ghost. Anyways the figure didn’t do anything but stand there. I do have a younger sister and what ever this was for sure not her. She didn’t have a white nightgown, or any nightgown for that matter. 
I was eleven at the time, so I was still young and my little brain raced with ideas of what it was. I stared at it for a long time I was petrified with fear. I knew it had to be either an intruder of my house or a ghost. Now I kinda suspected my house to be haunted to begin with m, some small unexplainable things have happened at my house. I also lived in a nice neighbor hood, no one really did anything illegal around here. So my young self assumed it to be a ghost. 
I figured it was female, only because it had long black hair and a white nightgown. Not I could move as I did move my legs a bit away from what I now assumed to be a spirit of some sort. But I didn’t want to move to much in fear of it looking at me, the last thing I wanted was to alert it, letting it know I was awake. So in that moment I decided to just close my eyes and go back to sleep. It was the only thing that I could think of doing at the time. Although now present time I wish I would have investigated it to maybe have some answers to know what it was. Eventually I did fall asleep, in the morning I woke up and nothing was amiss. 
I looked at the spot were the spirit had stood the night before and all was fine. I told me mum about it, she said nothing was wrong and that it was not an intruder. My mum is a religious person Christian to be specific, and when I made the comment of it being a spirit she just pushed that thought aside. She told me the house was blessed and such things were impossible to get in, what I saw that night proved other wise. Nothing else happened like this, but I do wish I learned what it was. 
Now I do wanna say my brother was in the room at the time but he was sound asleep. He also does not own any nightgowns, it was also not a large toy figure we owned. I know for a fact it was not my brain personifying an object in my room into a spirit looking thing. Now I do know the possibility of me being very tired and maybe my brain made a hallucination creating the figure in my imagination. I never rule that possibility out, but because my home is more than likely haunted I do lean more towards it being a spirit. 
I also wanna say that the nightgown did have a glow to it, which is why I ruled out intruder. We also had a nightlight so we could see in the dark, my brother would constantly leave legos on the ground, most people know how much of a pain it is to step on a lego. But the nightlight gave off a faint green light to the room. Not enough to make anything glow, also I want to note I was looking at the back of the spirit so even then the nightlight would not have made that part of it glow. So that’s why I think it’s a spirit, like I said it could have been hallucination the whole time though. 
Either way it was the earliest thing I can think of that was truly unexplainable that was actually scary. Just seeing a figure stare at you closet while you were sleeping in the room, the thought enough made my one friend shiver a bit in fear.</p>

I was asleep, I slept in a bunk bed, I was in the top bunk. There was a rail to keep me in the bed in case I was to roll in my sleep. The rail had a space between it and the bed frame that held my bed that I can see through. 
I woke up in the middle of the night, seemingly for no reason. But my face was in the space between the rail and my bed. Not something that happens ever this was and still is the first time I woke up like this. It was still pitch black outside as I looked at the curtains, if it was day time and the lights were off light would shine above and slightly through the fabric of the curtains in my room. I did not move my face mostly because I was tired and to lazy to move. 
Then I looked down to my floor, now what I expected to see was a cat maybe some toys or clothes on the floor not put where they should have been. But to my surprise I saw a figure, the figure was short. I’d estimate it at about maybe just below 3 foot. It was wearing all white, and seemingly was brighter than is should have been. Seeing as the lights were off, it stood there looking at my closet. When I was younger I had always thought of my closet to hold something paranormal in it. Not the bogeyman but maybe just a ghost. Anyways the figure didn’t do anything but stand there. I do have a younger sister and what ever this was for sure not her. She didn’t have a white nightgown, or any nightgown for that matter. 
I was eleven at the time, so I was still young and my little brain raced with ideas of what it was. I stared at it for a long time I was petrified with fear. I knew it had to be either an intruder of my house or a ghost. Now I kinda suspected my house to be haunted to begin with m, some small unexplainable things have happened at my house. I also lived in a nice neighbor hood, no one really did anything illegal around here. So my young self assumed it to be a ghost. 
I figured it was female, only because it had long black hair and a white nightgown. Not I could move as I did move my legs a bit away from what I now assumed to be a spirit of some sort. But I didn’t want to move to much in fear of it looking at me, the last thing I wanted was to alert it, letting it know I was awake. So in that moment I decided to just close my eyes and go back to sleep. It was the only thing that I could think of doing at the time. Although now present time I wish I would have investigated it to maybe have some answers to know what it was. Eventually I did fall asleep, in the morning I woke up and nothing was amiss.

Seeing as the lights were off, it stood there looking at my closet. When I was younger I had always thought of my closet to hold something paranormal in it. Not the bogeyman but maybe just a ghost. Anyways the figure didn’t do anything but stand there. I do have a younger sister and what ever this was for sure not her. She didn’t have a white nightgown, or any nightgown for that matter. 
I was eleven at the time, so I was still young and my little brain raced with ideas of what it was. I stared at it for a long time I was petrified with fear. I knew it had to be either an intruder of my house or a ghost. Now I kinda suspected my house to be haunted to begin with m, some small unexplainable things have happened at my house. I also lived in a nice neighbor hood, no one really did anything illegal around here. So my young self assumed it to be a ghost. 
I figured it was female, only because it had long black hair and a white nightgown. Not I could move as I did move my legs a bit away from what I now assumed to be a spirit of some sort. But I didn’t want to move to much in fear of it looking at me, the last thing I wanted was to alert it, letting it know I was awake. So in that moment I decided to just close my eyes and go back to sleep. It was the only thing that I could think of doing at the time. Although now present time I wish I would have investigated it to maybe have some answers to know what it was. Eventually I did fall asleep, in the morning I woke up and nothing was amiss. 
I looked at the spot were the spirit had stood the night before and all was fine. I told me mum about it, she said nothing was wrong and that it was not an intruder. My mum is a religious person Christian to be specific, and when I made the comment of it being a spirit she just pushed that thought aside. She told me the house was blessed and such things were impossible to get in, what I saw that night proved other wise. Nothing else happened like this, but I do wish I learned what it was. 
Now I do wanna say my brother was in the room at the time but he was sound asleep. He also does not own any nightgowns, it was also not a large toy figure we owned. I know for a fact it was not my brain personifying an object in my room into a spirit looking thing. Now I do know the possibility of me being very tired and maybe my brain made a hallucination creating the figure in my imagination. I never rule that possibility out, but because my home is more than likely haunted I do lean more towards it being a spirit. 
I also wanna say that the nightgown did have a glow to it, which is why I ruled out intruder. We also had a nightlight so we could see in the dark, my brother would constantly leave legos on the ground, most people know how much of a pain it is to step on a lego. But the nightlight gave off a faint green light to the room. Not enough to make anything glow, also I want to note I was looking at the back of the spirit so even then the nightlight would not have made that part of it glow. So that’s why I think it’s a spirit, like I said it could have been hallucination the whole time though. 
Either way it was the earliest thing I can think of that was truly unexplainable that was actually scary. Just seeing a figure stare at you closet while you were sleeping in the room, the thought enough made my one friend shiver a bit in fear.</p>

<p>this happened when I was probably about 13, in my first or second year of high school. I&#39;m graduating this year (hopefully), and even tho my memory is kinda shitty for some things, I remember this quite well. my school is in the city so every morning and afternoon I catch a bus to get home, probably about a 30-40 minute ride. I do choir one afternoon a week, and that finishes around 5pm, which in winter is pretty dark. I stg everyone else in the choir always got picked up by their parents but mine never would drive all that way and deal with the rubbish traffic when the bus is conveniently close. it doesn&#39;t bother me now but back then I was a young, naive child, so.. yknow. not great.</p>

<p>so, this one afternoon, a bit after 5pm, I get on a bus to head home. it&#39;s cold and already dark, and the traffic isn&#39;t great, but the bus is relatively empty. I head towards the back of the bus (it&#39;s an extra long one, we nickname them banana busses), but the back seat is taken up by this guy who&#39;s watching me walk down the aisle. I&#39;d been hoping his seat was free because I like to be able to spread out my bags, but I take the one in front of him instead.
because of the traffic, it&#39;s a longer trip than usual, and so I get out my laptop. it&#39;s kinda bumpy, so after I put in my password, I click on the thing that makes it viewable to check that I didn&#39;t make a typo. suddenly, I feel the guy in the seat behind me shift. I get the feeling he&#39;s interested in something, and I start feeling very uneasy.</p>

<p>I muck around on my laptop for the majority of the bus trip, but part of my mind is occupied on the guy in the seat behind me. I&#39;m generally good at getting vibes from people, and he gives me Bad Vibes with a capital B.</p>

<p>the bus finally gets to my suburb, and I press the bell for my stop. again, I hear him shift behind me. he hadn&#39;t seemed interested at all in the stop before I&#39;d pressed the bell.</p>

<p>I get up, suddenly nervous. it&#39;s fine, I tell myself, you&#39;re just being paranoid again. it&#39;s all good.
I pull my backpack on my back and grab the rest on my stuff, heading down the aisle of the bus with slightly shaky legs. I stop at the back door, and look back.</p>

<p>the guy is standing up, grabbing his bag.
my brain starts freaking the fuck out. I keep walking down the mostly empty bus, towards the front door instead. I&#39;m looking out the window now, as the bus heads down the hill towards my stop. my house is on the edge of a patch of bushland, and to get to it I&#39;m going to have to walk down a dark, abandoned, unofficial dirt path between the back fences of houses and the edge of the bush. in complete darkness. not good.</p>

<p>a glance backwards tells me that the guy is starting to make his way down the aisle. I look frantically around the bus again, at the few people left, and then suddenly someone stands up and steps towards me.</p>

<p>it&#39;s a lady, a younger mother, who lives two doors up from me. she&#39;s extremely kind and occasionally on my bus, but usually earlier in the afternoon.
I&#39;m still freaked out, but she doesn&#39;t seem to notice and starts chatting with me, asking about my day etc as the bus pulls up to our stop. I respond vaguely, my mind still all over the place. she leads me off the bus and into the cold night outside.</p>

<p>just before I step off, I look back towards the back of the bus.
the guy is sitting back down in his seat, still watching me intently.</p>

<p>to this day, I still wonder what would&#39;ve happened if she hadn&#39;t been on that bus with me. If I was just (and still am) quite paranoid. If I was just judging off Vibes (tho I did get bad vibes from a teacher around the same time who later got fired for being a pedophile... yeah...). If I was actually in danger, and if he had been planning to take my laptop or do something worse to me. If he would&#39;ve followed me down that dark, abandoned dirt path where no one was watching.</p>

<p>the lady who got off the bus with me has long since moved away, her house going through several different families since. now, if I&#39;m on the bus in the evening, I always wait for someone else to press the button, or press it myself only at the last minute. I take the longer, lit up and busy route home. I&#39;m still paranoid, but I listen to my instincts more.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t actually think I&#39;ve ever told anyone this story before.</p>

My younger sister and I had an old hand-me-down TV in our bedroom. This thing had wood siding on it, that old. About once a week, but always in the middle of the night, it would turn on by itself with the volume MAXED OUT, CLICKING AND FLASHING BLACK AND WHITE STATIC. Our mom had to drag her sleepy self into our room to unplug it for us as we would genuinely scream in terror when it would happen. We were around 5 and 7 years old, and had recently watched the movie Poltergeist... So that helped a bunch. Eventually we&#39;d routinely unplug it before bed, but that first month and a half or so was an absolutely terrifying learning curve.</p>

I was shocked and paralyzed in fear, i blinky and he was gone, like nothing happened, I have no idea idea how i went back to sleep again after what felt like hours of being scared, and when I woke up to go to school there was nothing in the corner, no chair, no cloths, no nothing that I could have mistaken it for. </p>

<p>Also for some random reason, I wake up before anything happens. For example, I woke up like a few seconds before an earthquake, multiple times. And I&#39;ve woken up before, again seconds before, hearing gun shots and/or loud bangs and crashes. As well, before the lights go out ( it&#39;s common here to have blackouts), and many more things.
No one in my family does this and I have no idea why I do this, it has been happening without fail since I was about 16 or 17 ( I&#39;m 21). When I explain it to anyone I feel like they don&#39;t believe me, but I really does happen and I get scared that I will one day hear how someone breaks into my home just as I woke up a few seconds before.</p>

My and my dog were just staring up there. Then the we heard 2 more and it stopped. Then I heard a noise in the dinning room. I thought I saw a shadow of some sorts in there. I shined my in the dinning room I saw something run away. I just stood there staring while I had my fishing pole as my weapon of choice. Then I heard a freaking of a rocking chair back and forth back and forth. After that it was over nothing else happened. It just made me wonder what was truly happing. Also I was watching one of Markiplier&#39;s Uno videos. So I hoped you enjoyed my true story. I hope you have a good night it was a pleasure talking to you.

I was scared as shit at thos moment, putting myself under the blankets and never taking an eye of that thing, when it got blocked, I was petrified, and then it came back. It started going on top of the bed of my brother while I just stared. It got at the side of my bed and it didn&#39;t stop at any moment, even when it was that close, I was still not able to discern any kind of bug or arachnid.
It got in my blanket, I didn&#39;t move, hoping it were to go away, but it didn&#39;t, and I felt something bite me. That&#39;s were I freaked out and started shuffling myself all around hoping it would dissapear, and it did.
I still don&#39;t know was that and if it did something when it bite me, but I&#39;m still alive so I guess nothing deadly,</p>

<p>If there&#39;s any spelling mistake let my know so I get better with my english</p>

<p>So one time I was babysitting my aunt and uncles 1-year-old kiddo. I was younger at the time and did not have a phone so my aunt left me hers. Anyway, they said they would be back at around 1am ( they did not get back till like 4am ). So at about 2:36 am I went to put my niece to bed because she was getting fussy. Now I have babysat before and it was rare for a kid that young to completely shut up. So about 5 minutes in, my niece goes dead silent, no cooing, no soft whimpers. Nothing. I got a little nervous but I figured she just fell asleep, it was late after all. That&#39;s when the baby monitor went off, I did not even bother to check it, I bolted into the room and the minute I stepped into the room I grew sick to my stomach and that haunting feeling that something was here that should not be.  I pushed it aside and scooped up my niece who was very awake when I picked her up she started giggling. I felt relief until out of the corner of my eye in the mirror I saw movement. I slowly turned my head and the rocking chair was moving back and forth with very steady movement, consistent movement. I vomited in my mouth a little from fear. I let my motherly instincts kick in and laid my niece down on the couch when I ran out of her room. I took a knife from the kitchen and checked the air vents, thinking the wind moved the rocking chair (no air), then checked in on lucy ( Their spudsmackinze ) who was asleep in her doggy bed, checked the locks on all the doors and windows and sweeped the house. nothing. I then went back into the room slowly, the rocking chair still going slowly back and forth ( you would think it stopped by now, especially being on carpet ) I ripped open the closet. Nothing.  At this point, it has been 10 minutes and he rocking chair still moved. I calmly shut the door, scooped up my niece and cried for thirty minutes on the couch as the baby monitor went on and off... At around 3:12 I put her back in her room with the door open, now that the rocking chair was still, I played it cool when my aunt and uncle came home.</p>

<p>I remember sitting in that chair four hours prior, Never sat in that chair again in my life</p>

<p>The scariest part, I never told this story to anybody in my life, and when my cousin came down ( she was about 23 yo ) who I have not seen in months, shared a scary story with us that involved that same rocking chair when she watched my niece. After a while, I told my aunt, who laughed and says her mother thinks that the closet in my niece&#39;s room is haunted. Coincidence? I think not</p>

<p>So this story is my first I&#39;d have to say paranormal experience I was about 5 maybe 6 at a summer camp in Montana and everyone had was in a cabin with about five or six other kids with an adult to watch us these adults were called camp counselors anyway one night about half way through the week it started to hail and being curious kids we wanted to go out and the cabins deck and watch the storm the hail was the size of golf balls and we were just messing around like kids do and out of nowhere I realize some of the hail is coming towards the cabin at a horizontal angle from the woods behind the cabin and I look into the woods and I see this neon green figure that looks like a man with a goat&#39;s head and some weird staff so being curious I go to the other side of the cabin to get a better look at it and I just see it fade into darkness to this day idk what I saw or if anyone else saw it</p>

When I was around 16, I had this reoccurring experience that would happen once or twice every few months (specifically when I wouldn’t get enough sleep the last few nights). 
I’d go to bed and have a dream about this black silhouette that of a woman hovering above me. The only recognizable features on her face were her white eyes staring back at me and teeth. She would smirk at me really wide, then I’d wake up. That’s not the scary part. 
I’d wake up lying flat, with an overwhelming sense of dread and not be able to move or go turn on the lights because of how intensely petrified I would be. After that a few minutes of lying there, not being able to move, i felt a pressure on my back. The closest I can come to describing it would be if someone was under your bed pushing the mattress with their hands, but like more than one set and they’re all over your back. 
Every time this would happen, I couldn’t go back to sleep. I’d either have to build up enough courage to turn on the lights or wait until the sun comes up to get up and out of my bed for it to stop. 
I don’t believe in the supernatural and think it might’ve been some form of sleep paralysis and reoccurring nightmares combined, but that doesn’t make it any less terrifying to me.</p>

<p>It’s more of a nightmare, it was when I was really young. It was when the Energizer bunny commercials where coming out, I went to bed right after I stopped watching T.V. because my mom told me to.</p>

<p>I suddenly woke up, or thought I woke up, and saw a green Energizer bunny with glowing red eyes right next to my bed, and it shocked me. This is where it gets weird. It was almost like I genuinely woke up but I could only see for a moment, and what did I see? My body seizing uncontrollably, then I woke up.</p>

<p>It wasn’t my imagination, (I was in a bunk with my brother) my brother woke up from my shaking body and thought I was dying, but I woke up. The thing is, the last thing I saw on the T.V. that night, was an Energizer commercial.</p>

That night I had a dream about someone I cared dying, the dream didn&#39;t say who it just was very eerie and I felt unsafe. I woke up around 2am and the song Suicide by James Aurther was playing. I just remember staring at the wall thinking it couldn&#39;t be true. I shrugged it off and tried going back to sleep. Later on in the night I heard frantic rustling noises and I thought nothing of it because my mom goes to work at 5am and she must have been running late. So around 6am I get ready for a school event and my mom drives me there. She told me what happened, she didn&#39;t tell me the details but she told me around 2am my to be brother-in-law committed suicide and my sister found him. Since them my sister hasn&#39;t been  the same. But since that incident I learned I have a 6th sense.</p>

I have this pitbull who honestly is a super soft boi but because he’s a pitbull, people are scared of him. Also he loves me so much I’m sure he protect me. In my mind I figured, “hey, I’m a paranoid young woman I am going to take my doggo with me to feel safe.”</p>

<p>Well just parked outside of our house for some reason there was this red truck. It was dark so seeing much else was super difficult. At the hood of it there’s a muscular (drunk?) man standing there, watching me. I try not to act startled so I slightly avoid him and have my dog follow me. As I’m coming back I notice he’s gone which I was super happy about. But then my dog, Jax, stopped in the middle of our front yard, growling. (He NEVER actually growls) I turn around and look in that direction. That guy was crouched behind the bed of the truck. And we made eye contact. I rushed inside, calling my dog to come with me. When I told my grandpa I expected the guy to be gone but he was just standing behind it looking through his front window. It was four hours before he disappeared.</p>

<p>Maybe we should’ve called the cops but my grandpa didn’t want to deal with it plus he’s a veteran so he feels pretty confident of his ability to keep us safe. And my friend thought I was exaggerating when I messaged her. However it was terrifying and I have no idea why he was so persistent on staring at me. I think Jax scared him. </p>

<p>Basically, my dog possibly saved me 🥰</p>

<p>I had woken up one night in the old house I used to live in, I woke up on the opposite end of my bed that I had fell asleep on, I was thinking like wtf; all of a sudden I feel this sense of being watched, I looked around and in front of my door seemed to be a tall skinny figure with pale skin and long black hair, in my mind I’m thinking it’s nothing, a second later I her a gentle yet raspy voice say “don’t look at me”. Traumatized I quickly looked away trying to fall asleep. The room got very cold, I eventually fell asleep. In the morning I had looked back at the spot I had seen the figure, there was nothin there, no clothing or anything else. My family had left that night out of town.</p>

To set the scene i lived in a three bedroom single story house in the eastern united states, there were two rooms occupying the east-facing side of the house, one of which was an office and one which was my room. Shortly after falling asleep one night i remember waking up to my corgi growling at my window, it was summer so my window shades were open, as well as, the window which was half open. I’m normally a pretty hard sleeper so i opened my eyes and looked out the window just to face a large figure (roughly 6’4”), all his features were shaded by the path lights leading to our front door. I went to scream for my father but my vocal cords couldn’t produce the sounds i needed. I had to watch terrified until i fell back asleep. (Disclaimer: this may have been a dream but it still haunts me)</p>

We were sharing a room with our brother who was 9 at the time, and my sister had night terrors. Because of her night terrors my bed was right next to hers so I could bring her back to reality whenever she was scared. She would always talk about “ghosts” that she saw but we knew it was all in her head. One night I had woken up because I thought I heard my sister, but when I looked over she was fast asleep. I thought nothing of it and was about to go to bed when I looked at our door(which was always open so my mom could hear us) and saw a figure. At this point my sister had woken up and was confused at how I was seeing the same thing she was. The figure started walking closer and revealed itself as a woman. The only problem was that she had a gun and we could see straight through her. She started shooting at us but when we looked at the wall there were no marks. She then started shooting at my brother, who was still fast asleep, but again there was no trace or evidence that anything hit the wall. Neither of us remember what happened next besides waking up in the morning. We are now 15 and 16 years old and still can’t explain what happened that night.
</code></pre>

<p>P.S. We didn’t realize this, but we apparently didn’t tell anyone that it happened until the beginning of this year, so our older sister who had the room it happened in after us was a mix of anger that we didn’t tell her, fear for obvious reasons, and overall confusion at how we didn’t say anything about it for so long.</p>

I was at my   school (it was an elementary/junior high school, now closed) and I was in the restroom. When I walked out of the restroom, I was in the breezeway of the school. In the dream it was raining heavily with lightning, and for some reason the lightning was red. I’m walking through the breezeway when I look out to one of the streets adjacent to the school. I look out and I just see this man looking at me. His eyes were red and full of what I thought was anger. Every time I blinked in the dream, he would move just a bit closer to the school. The dream ended with the man up in my face, his eyes staring directly at me, and hearing a scream as I woke up. Lo and behold, a week later, there’s a fucking guy in a black trench coat across the street looking at the school. It’s raining and there’s lightning, and the lightning as it turns out was red, but only due to the fluorescent lights of a buildings sign. I eventually found out that the man standing across the street would lure out kids because he was a pedophile, and his eyes were red that day because he was high as shit. Seriously though, that scared me so much, and had I or gotten the full story, I might’ve made myself go crazy.</p>

<p>So in one of my old houses I often saw this apparition of a little girl named Vanessa. She had dirty brown hair and an older styled purple dress. 
So one day I was in my room that I shared with my little sister, and I heard a female voice calling my name from outside the window. I look outside and didn&#39;t see anything. So i sad on my bed again. But my name was called again so i glanced outside and shouted lut the window for my sister to knock it off. I was annoyed till i remembered my little sister wasnt home at the time. Me having watched ghost shows  went outside to investigate. The voice led me to the wood where i saw tje most gruesome scene ever. The little girl way laying across a big rock where me and my neighbor often played at. A tall man was standing over her with a knife i think in his hand. The little girl was cut open and bleeding out and no longer moving. The man noticing me turned and came running at me.  I ran away screaming. I&#39;ve never run faster in my life. my step dad ended up finding me when i stepped out of those woods. </p>

<p>Needless to say i never wanted to go bck in them

<p>There use to be a barn behind my house and about 50 years ago a man hung himself in it. </p>

<p>One night around 3 am I woke up. I was laying sprawled out in the shape of a star and my blanket was on the other side of the room. I look over and my phone is on. There is a message being typed to my dad (who I only talk to occasionally) that says “hi how are you”. I assumed I had rolled on it in my sleep and pressed the suggestions on the keyboard. I am slightly afraid of the dark and I am really freaked out at this point. I then turn on my flashlight on my phone. I am on my side so I roll over and I see a LARGE black figure standing over me. I pull the covers over my head as a first instinct. When I look again its gone. I turn on my light and I am up the rest of the night. I have had other experiences like this one living in my home (waking up to screams, slamming doors, etc). I assume all this is just the hangman paying me a visit...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not one to be overtly superstitious, but I&#39;ve always had an interest in paranormal stuff and what have you. I even joined a ghost hunting crew as pretty much the skeptic of the group among a baptist christian, a Mormon, an atheist, hell there was even someone in the group who studied demonology. It was a very cool time and very interesting and enlightening part of my life. Though, until then I never could say I had any paranormal experiences prior. All for except one specific instance that I remember when I was in middle school. </p>

<p>I grew up in a very pentecostal christian family, with very devout christian parents. Me, I&#39;ve always had trouble with my faith in God, and, while not really disclosing my feelings of my faith to my parents, I believe they&#39;ve had concerns about it for a while. I wasn&#39;t eager to go to church, not gonna lie. </p>

<p>Then, my church was having this event called an &quot;encuentro&quot;. Spanish for &quot;encounter&quot;. I&#39;m not sure if other faiths have a similar thing or whatever.  In summary, it was an event where they had the youths of the church go to this big church and sleep there for an entire weekend where it was nothing but surrounding yourself with God for 2 whole nights. I went, mostly to hang out with my friends, but also to maybe build on that faith I mentioned earlier. Well, 2 whole days of singing hymns, praying, reciting gospels, memorizing bible verses, all that stuff, and my feelings remained the same.</p>

<p>Then came the final night. This night, the preacher finished his story of Christs resurrection, and he asked us to pray and confess our sins. To pray for God to reach our hearts. I&#39;ve never been good at praying but I did what I usually did. I hung my head and closed my eyes and muttered what came to mind and casually prayed and said what was honestly on my mind. However this time, I felt something different. I don&#39;t know what it was, but I can tell you this.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t feel like God.</p>

<p>Out of no where, I felt these nails sink deep in my left shoulder. This grip felt tight, and the nails felt like they dug right into my skin, I could have sworn they were claws. The sounds of hissing though, this violently loud hissing in my ear is what scarred me the most. My body jolted in fear as I felt the warm breath right next to my ear, relentlessly hissing, but I didn&#39;t open my eyes. I was too terrified. All I did then, was pray louder and cry, hoping it would just go away. And just like that, it did. Immediately, I looked over to where I felt the damn thing. Unfortunately, it was just a wall. Nobody was nearby, except to some other guys to my right, who were crying and praying like I was. I went back to praying, shaking from the fear. </p>

<p>I still don&#39;t know what it was. But sometimes the thought comes across my mind that maybe I did know what it was. I&#39;m just still in denial about it. Honestly...I really hope it was just the pastor or someone trying to scare me. I can&#39;t tell you for certain though and that&#39;s what scares me...</p>

We were very excited about that trip for a few reasons, but the main one for most people was the idea that that place was haunted.  The cabins were numbered from 1 to 12, 1 being the first on the hill and 12 being the last one, all the way up to the top. 12 was called &quot;Mist&quot; and it was the only unoccupied cabin, mine was &quot;Star&quot;, the 11th cabin.</p>

<p>One night we sat around a fire and the workers there told us the story of that ghost, and tried to prank us with a few spooky costumes, but it wasn&#39;t that scary. That same night we played a game called &quot;find the teachers&quot;, where basically our teachers hid and we had to look for them in groups. I turned to my group of friends and said &quot;let&#39;s go check Mist, someone must be hiding there&quot; and started going up.</p>

<p>When I looked back to check on them, I realised I was alone, right next to the haunted cabin. I hear a noise and immediatly looked foward, shaking. I saw a shadow that wasn&#39;t mine being casted on the wall I was looking, I turned back and started running like I&#39;ve never ran before, I looked back to make sure no one was following me when I suddently hit a tree and fell down. I was in too much pain to even get up, so I accepted my fate. It was then a friend of mine found me looked me with a &quot;bruh wtf&quot; face and asked why I ran away when he got there.</p>

When I rolled out of the bed I saw a younger version of me, maybe 8 or 9 years old standing next to the bed staring at me with a big smile on his face holding a knife in his hand. Just as I began to think he was going to stab me with the knife he spins it around, stabbing into his own chest once, twice, three times all while staring at me with a smile on his face.</p>

<p>During the stabbing I woke up in my own bed shaking with a pain in my chest, the same place the younger version of me was stabbing himself in the dream. I told myself it was just a dream and moved on from it. However a few weeks later while looking for reference to use for a modeling assignment, I found a picture of a cabin. A Wooden building with rock foundations, while I never saw the exterior of the cabin in the dream it gave me an eerie feeling that I had been there before, that it was the exact same cabin that dream took place in. to this day I can still see it. whether or not it was just a deja vu scenario it scared the crap out of me.</p>

Some people believe in ghosts and others do not... tbh I&#39;m skeptical myself, but I&#39;ve experienced crazy things that make me believe in ghosts more and more...</p>

<p>When I was a kid, I would often get woken up by a girl&#39;s voice in my room. I was woken up one night by someone (that was not there.) On the edge of my bed, it felt like they were jumping on the bed. Then, the jumping ceased, and I felt someone touch my knee... it felt like they were crawling over me. Then I heard a loud whisper in my ear that made me jump up from my sleep. I was a kid but I KNEW this was not a dream... and I have no history with sleep paralysis.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I would set a voice recorder in my room at night. It would be completely silent in there but in the recordings... there was something unheard from my ears. A little girl, possibly the same one that whispered in my ear, said &quot;play with me&quot; she even said my name! This actually happened multiple times... I would hear giggling around the house and one night I even saw a little girl sitting on the edge of the bed. I probably sound so delusional and this is why I never tell my stories... but this is real. It&#39;s not even the end of my stories ...</p>

<p>One night also when I was a kid, I layed in bed as if I was laying next to someone. No one else was in the room. I was pretending to be talking to Abraham Lincoln xD I was a kid so I did some weird stuff.... but I was pretending to have a full on conversation with this imaginary friend. I got up and said &quot;okay I&#39;m going to flip the pillow now, because It&#39;s getting hot on this side&quot; and then as I lift the pillow. I feel a head roll off the pillow... as if someone was laying next to me. I felt the weight of it on the pillow... I layed there the rest of the night super freaked out. </p>

<p>I have a TON more stories... I&#39;ll post them all separately.</p>

<p>It all started when I was 5 years old, although what happened exactly was blurry, I can clearly remember the significant details. Basically, I had caught a terrible sickness back when I was still living in UAE. I was coughing uncontrollably all the time and it got so bad to the point when my hair started falling, my mom says that I nearly went bald. Doctor after doctor, test result after test result they weren&#39;t able to find what was wrong with me. One night after a visit to another hospital, I remember being extremely tired (Because I was walking around a lot that day and I was pretty young). I jumped into my bed after a warm bath and my mom tucked me in, she was hesitant to leave me that night, as I was coughing more than usual. She made me drink my cough syrup and left the room. As a child, I wasn&#39;t all that scared of the dark because my ceiling was covered with glow in the dark stars. But something wasn&#39;t right because there was a painful tightness in my chest. I didn&#39;t want to go get my mom about this because I was a dumb kid, also because she looked really tired. Looking back, she was probably still awake that night, looking for a doctor that could help me. Regardless of the pain, I was still extremely tired, so I just went to sleep.</p>

<p>Late at night, a force suddenly pushes my back, causing me to sit up. Startled, I quickly get out of bed and look around trying to see why that happened. As I look around, I see myself sleeping in my bed. Out of curiosity, I move closer towards myself and try to poke my sleeping head. Astonishingly, my finger went through its face. Being a small five-year-old girl with a wild imagination, I thought that I became a ghost. Rather than being scared, I thought it was cool ( I wasn&#39;t allowed to watch horror movies as a kid, so I was relatively clean in that area). I run around my room to touch things, and just as expected, my hands went through everything. While I was running around having fun, I suddenly felt a presence behind me. I turn around to see a tall black figure in black robes. Despite how it looked, the aura it gave off wasn&#39;t scary or repelling. Instead, the feeling it gave off was peaceful and attracting. The figure held out its hand like it wanted me to take it, I could immediately feel my hand move on its own. As my hand grew close to the hand of the figure, I increasingly felt more uncomfortable, Like something wasn&#39;t right. I suddenly feel something grab my shoulder and throw me away from the figure, I landed on my bed. I blacked out after that.</p>

<p>In the morning I found myself sweating, I look around my room. The figure was gone. I brushed off the experience as a bad dream because I usually have crazy dreams all the time. I didn&#39;t want to tell my mom because I knew she was stressed out and didn&#39;t have time for my stories.</p>

<p>A week or two later, My mom finally found a doctor that could help me. I was then diagnosed with Bronchial Pneumonia.</p>

<p>I fully recovered from it at 8 years old.</p>

<p>For many years until now (I&#39;m 14 now) I have continued to have that type of experience, except that the black figure isn&#39;t present anymore. For 6 years I thought it was a normal bad dream, until 7th grade (When I was 11). I shared a recent story of that one of my recent experiences (at the time). One of my classmates explained to me that what had been happening to me all this time was something along the lines of astral projection. That night, I googled astral projection and felt sceptical. Out of curiosity, I called a friend whose mom was supposedly a psychic. I told her my story, something I have never done before that time. I remember feeling embarrassed because for all I knew it really could&#39;ve been a bad dream. My friend&#39;s mom explained to me that during that night I nearly died in my sleep and that the black figure in my room was death, he was coming to collect me. However, the thing that grabbed me away from him was a guardian angel or deity of some sort. I was surprised but still sceptical. Until today I still go around asking people who might have answers to my story. Priests, psychics, mediums, even science and psychology teachers to see if there were any logical explanations. Science and psychology teachers weren&#39;t able to answer me, but the priests, psychics and mediums always say similar things.</p>

<p>&quot;You were supposed to die that night, and you were being picked up.&quot;</p>

<p>Regardless of whether or not they are telling the truth, If it is true, I&#39;m thankful for the thing that saved me. This is the first time I have publicly shared my story, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if most people don&#39;t believe me. Believe what you want to believe, I&#39;m not trying to stop or change that fact. If there is anyone out there who has similar experiences that I have, please reach out to me.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t know anything about what happens to me every time I have &quot;astral projection&quot;, but what I do is that every time I get more tired than usual, When I fall asleep, I enter that state.</p>

<p>So I sleep over at my best friends house all the time, we’ve been best friends for going on 14 years now, and this happened probably when we were 16 or 17 I think? So she has a pullout bed that goes next to hers, and we sometimes switch which one we sleep on. That night, I slept on the bed closest to the farthest wall from the closet, and she slept on the outside bed.</p>

<p>I mentioned the closet because this is the creepiest closet I’ve ever seen in my life. It sits right in the corner of the room, the light from the window hits the door just right to where you can’t see inside, and the door cannot shut, it always stays slightly open. Now back to our tale of horror.</p>

<p>My friend has always talked in her sleep, but it’s always been simple nonsense. Random words, some gibberish here and there, but she doesn’t do it often, and it never makes sense. She always goes to sleep before I do, and I can always tell when she’s sleeping, as her breath pattern changes and becomes deeper and slowed. She was asleep, I had checked, but I was quietly listening to music, or watching one of Mark’s videos, I can’t remember. Suddenly, she sits bolt upright, like her body was suddenly full of electricity. Humans usually don’t sit at a perfect ninety degree angle with their legs out in front of them.</p>

<p>I immediately stopped what I was doing and looked at her. “Hey [bestie]? You awake?” No response. I listened to her breathing, still slowed and deep, her eyes still shut, facing forward. She was still asleep. I sat as still as I could, slightly worried. But as soon as I thought I maybe should lay her back down, her head started to turn. Slowly, it turned until she was directly looking at me, but her eyes were closed the whole time. Still the same slow deep breaths. One second. Two seconds. Silence. And then,</p>

<p>“...watch out for.. that man in the corner.” As her arm raised up, hand outstretched toward the closet.</p>

<p>And as quickly as she sat up, she fell back down with her head in the pillow, breathing as calmly as she had the whole time, eyes still closed. I didn’t sleep that night.</p>

<p>I asked her about it in the morning, and she had absolutely no recollection of what I was talking about, and told me that she had slept wonderfully.</p>

<p>I still don’t go near the closet.</p>

<p>My sister was 6 years old and my brother was 15 years old when this happened in the very late 70s. they where both watching a movie on a Saturday night in the basement, after the movie ended my brother noticed that my sister fell alseep on the sofa instead of waking my sister and bringing my sister to her bed he just went upstairs to his bed he said after he didn&#39;t want to bother her by waking her so he just left her on the sofa. Hours later my sister woke up instead of silent and darkness that should greet you when you wake up in the middle of the night she herd what sounded like a dinner party going on she said she could hear glasses clinking and a lot of people talking but she couldn&#39;t make out what they where saying. My sister was too terrified to move as she listened to the sounds in the darkness but suddenly the noises stopped and everything was silent for a couple of seconds then very close to her she herd someone say &quot;shhhhh... she&#39;s scared&quot; and all the noises stopped, my sister rolled onto her other side so she was facing the back of the sofa and didn&#39;t move for the rest of the night. In the morning my mother found her on the sofa crying she told my mother everything that happened. My brother was scolded for leaving her there. The only other person living close to my parents house was my grandparents as my parents lived out of town at the time.
In the basement there was a sofa, tv and a armchair and a pool table (the pool table came with the house) my mother hated that basement she said that she&#39;d go to open the door to the basement to go down but she would hear what sound like the billiard balls where moving around like someone was playing pool and she would here that sound alot, she wouldn&#39;t not go down there alone not until other people where home. This is one of the spooky story my mother always tells when there is a lighting storm and the power goes out. My parents moved out of that house in the mid 80s.</p>

<p>My story</p>

<p>Me and my twin brother where born in 1988 and this happened when where 3 years old. My parents went out for the evening so our older siblings where babysitting us, when my parents got home my twin brother was waiting for them by the door, he started pulling my mothers arm and repeatedly said &quot;let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go, ghost&quot; after my mother calmed him down she asked him where the ghost was he pointed down the hall toward our bedroom. My mother left him with my father and went to our room when she got there she said I was playing in the middle of the room with my toys, she greeted me and asked me if I was scaring my brother I said &quot;no&quot; then she asked me if I saw a ghost, she said I pointed to the window and I said a man floated though the window and floated around the room and floated back out the window, as I told her this I circled around the room with my finger. She let both of us sleep in there bedroom that night.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to make of these stories but some scary family stories to tell when the power goes out.</p>

My name&#39;s Emily and this happened a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>-Just to clarify, we live in a pretty good neighbourhood.    To show you how safe it is, (or so we thought) a few days before this happened, my dad took me to my drumming lesson. We were gone for about an hour and when we came back home, we realised that we had left the key in the lock OUTSIDE the whole time. No one took it nor came in. This has happened before.</p>

<p>Now, onto the actual story:</p>

<p>One night at about 11 PM, my mum and I were in the sitting room. My dad and sis were in bed. My mum was asleep on the couch and I was playing PUBG mobile. At one point, I could hear noises coming from the hallway, thinking it was the cats I brushed it off. I started to hear more noise and thought &quot;what the f*** are they doing&quot;. Then, I saw something roll on the floor by the dining room table and one of the cats walking up to it. Again thinking it was the cats. The object however, was placed on top of a vanity we have in the hallway. They don&#39;t go on top of that but we do have a 9-10 month old curious kitten. 
I then heard a male voice. At first I thought it might be one of my teammates in the game talking. I quickly realized it was not. I then thought my dad had gotten up. Which is pretty common for him. So I asked my mum (didn&#39;t realise she was falling asleep) if my dad had come down and if it was him. She sleepily said yes. So i tried to brush it off again. 
Suddenly, i see this thing, (which I found out after were cleaning wipes for the interior of cars that were placed on the vanity) flying at me and landing on the floor or on the stool in front of me, I don&#39;t  remeber. I thought &quot;that can&#39;t be the cats&quot;. I got up walked over to the hallway. I got to the step when I realized that my dads walking stick and a straw hat that was on top of our coat hanger were on the floor. (Neither cat has ever gotten on top of it). I walked up the step and heard movement in the office. It was dark. The office is right next to the front door about 2 meters from the living room front door. I thought it might be my sister looking for something. And then, this guy gets up, comes out of the room, goes to the front door, unlocks it and walks out. He was wearing a hoodie and I didn&#39;t see his face. I was paralyzed with fear and confusion. My mind immediately went to &quot;do I know him?&quot;. After he left I yelled out to my mum that someone just walked out. She was obviously confused and concerned. We realised he came in from the back door which was unlocked. He either climbed the gate which is about 2 meters high I think or walked up the neighbours stairs and then over the wall. (You can see the back door from the street) The only things he took were the back door keys and a bluetooth player we believe. Which we don&#39;t care about. We made a barricade that would make noise if he came back. And sat with knives and a big two tooth fork until about 5 am. We had another lock so dad changed it the next day. I slept with the knife under my bed that night.</p>

<p>Looking back I wish I had done something. I played rugby for 2 years. I know the basics to tackle. But I couldn&#39;t move. Obviously because of fear but my brain was also trying to understand what was happening. I probably could have taken him on. He was very thin and looked to be between 17 and 19, 20  at most judging by his style and body. We think we might know who did it. But they didn&#39;t &quot;brake in&quot;. They only took two things. Walked past all our valuables. He didn&#39;t do anything to us. It almost looked like he was trying to get my attention as well. Almost as If it was a bet and he tried to find a reason to get out. Either that or he&#39;s the worst robber I&#39;ve heard of. I&#39;m just happy my sister was in bed. It probably would have been a different story if she had been there with us. </p>

<p>A lot of people think they know how they&#39;d react in certain situations. I am living proof you don&#39;t. I thought I&#39;d scream at least, but nothing. </p>

<p>We now lock our doors every night. Everytime I hear a noise I get a little frightened. But I&#39;m okay. If he wanted to hurt me, he would have tried. We got lucky.</p>

<p>Tdlr: someone came into the house and I came face to face with them when they walked out. </p>

<p>I hope this was entertaining if not eye opening. If you want pics to help clarify some aspects of the story please ask. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading! Have a good night/day and stay safe! Hope everyone is okay x</p>

This is my great grandfather’s story that my grandpa told me.</p>

<p>My Great Grandfather was a First World War veteran. He was a Sergeant (spelt Serjeant at the time) in a volunteer battalion of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). He arrived in France in 1915, and from what I could tell, was there for most or all of the war. He was in his early 20s.</p>

<p>The scary story occurred around mid March 1916. While advancing into No-Man’s-Land, his commanding officer was shot, the bullet passing through both his legs. He was unable to stand, so my Great Grandfather grabbed him and attempted to carry him back to the trench. </p>

<p>He reached the trench, but was horrified by what he heard. From just down the trench, he couldn’t hear anyone speaking English, only German. In the confusion or darkness he had carried his officer in the wrong direction. He hoisted him back over his shoulders and ran as fast as he could. He eventually made it back after carrying his officer for over 300 yards, saving his life.</p>

<p>For his actions that day he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.</p>

<p>I once did a school project on him, and asked my grandpa a lot of questions about my great grandfather (and even found old photos of him in his kilt). My grandpa said that his father never talked about his WWI experience that much, and rarely talked about that night specifically. I can see why. </p>

<p>TLDR; My Great Grandfather accidentally dragged his wounded officer into a German trench and somehow escaped during World War I</p>

<p>I was at my Grandma&#39;s apartment one day after work and I heard some really weird noises outside her apartment. We were sitting in the living room watching tv when I noticed Ice Cream truck type of music outside. I peeked outside to see if maybe there was an icecream truck passing by but I didn&#39;t see anything. The music was slow and distorted and that made me feel very uneasy...
This would play for maybe 20 seconds and stop. </p>

<p>The odd thing was that it would only be on one direction and there was no one there, and it was fall time too so there shouldn&#39;t have been an icecream truck around. </p>

<p>I thought it was over but it wasn&#39;t. The music came back, from around the same place it was playing. This time I decided to go outside and see where this music was coming from. It sounded as if it was coming from a distance and I didn&#39;t see anyone around or anything out of place. It had stopped again.</p>

<p>This time I was honestly starting to get freaked out... we went back to the apartment and the music cAME BACK this time it sounded like Old McDonald Had a Farm but it was slow... and distorted... this music came on and off for about 10 - 15 minutes. The music wasn&#39;t coming from any of the rooms in the apartment, it was coming from afar. I never saw any Ice Cream truck or anything like that... nor anyone outside while this music played. It was so freaky... the sound would shift from right to left as if coming from all over.</p>

<p>1st story -  I&#39;m bat shit petrified of clowns . Like more than the average person . And I was about 4 I would say , I used to watch the IT movie like every day . Why ? I have no idea . But , my mom had put me to bed for the night , and when I was little my bed faced directly toward the window . I remember , very vividly , seeing the mf clown hop up on my air conditioner unit and WAVE at me . I don&#39;t know if it was when I was falling asleep , or I woke up and saw it , but I remember it . I tried telling my grandma about it the next day and she just thought I was dreaming . But I know for a fact i wasn&#39;t not .</p>

<p>2nd story -  maybe not that scary , but sometimes I will be drifting to sleep (even now) and right when you&#39;re in that space where you&#39;re not quite sleeping , and if someone were to say something you&#39;d be able to hear it and understand it but not quite answer it ,  is when itd happen . I&#39;d be right in that space , and I would feel something sitting down all the way at the end of my bed , or right by my feet . I would wake up the second I felt that , and it would disappear , and i wouldn&#39;t be able to see anything , no entity , no explanation , nada. my mom passed away five years ago when I was ten, and my dad and I still love in the same home . I wonder if that&#39;s her sometimes and I feel oddly comforted.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I want to keep my buddies identity safe so I’ll call him Tom, Tom was always a very optimistic person, even when we were in training in the desert of California together and he told me “ this fucking sucks “ he always had a smile on his face about it, he was one of those guys. So when he told me his story I thought nothing of it until I actually processed what he told me and the reality of it hasn’t left my memory.</p>

<p>Me and Tom we’re reminiscing about our previous year in the corps. Tom had just got back from Syria. I forget how it came up but we both brought up how we had sleep paralysis and haven’t been able to sleep. For me, my bed sits right by my door, perpendicular. I would be sleeping in my bed and a dark silhouette would open my door and grab my ankles and start dragging me out of my bed, I still remember the feeling of the tension around my legs as I struggle to break the spell of helplessness. I was genuinely scared to goto sleep for months, not being able to move a muscle, unable to scream to my roommate for help. Nothing ever helped and I was just a cowardly victim who had to take this punishment until it was fated that I had suffered enough and would be allowed to wake up, still to this day I’ll get it every now and then but I’ll take that over every single day, only getting 2 honest hours of sleep before having to be up at 4am for work.</p>

<p>I have trouble recollecting Tom’s story, maybe my brain tried pushing it out of my head so I wouldn’t have the same fate as him, but I’ll try tell it with the best of my memory.I have to give the back story of Tom’s experience for it to make sense.</p>

<p>It was in country, his unit was supporting our special forces In operations so they’d go on convoys with them. Whenever they’d go through a village they were trained to point their weapons at anyone who came to their vehicles as they passed; as shitty as it sounds the enemy would strap IEDs to children and use them as bait to kill any unsuspecting opposing forces. But how can you hate children? Growing up in America it’s natural to be friendly towards kids, not point a gun at everyone you see. These kids would run up to the trucks and shoot up the peace sign to Tom and his company to show they were with the allied forces and they supported our American military, and naturally they all shot the peace sign back. Tom grew especially close to one small girl he would notice every time they passed through, they eventually built a friendship and would wave to each other as they passed through</p>

<p>One day, as Tom’s convoy was leaving the village, there was a large explosion. It came from the congregation of children that would routinely run to the trucks and greet his convoy with blankets of friendship as they passed. A child set to take as many American casualties as possible was too late to detonate, and only took her adolescent peers with her.</p>

<p>Witnessing this horrific event became engrained in his head, and it followed him home. When he returned back from deployment he got a room to himself and also received an achievement medal for his actions in country. This is where his nightmares began. Every night when Tom went to bed he would be awoken to the little girl’s laughter in the corner of his room, only becoming more sinister the more she continued to cackle. Unable to move a muscle he was forced to watch and listen to his demon torment him, a constant reminder of what he witnessed a few months back.
                        Every.Single.Day.</p>

<p>Tom told me this story with a smile on his face so I didn’t think much of it. If this demon still haunts him to this day I don’t know, he refuses to tell me his story again and pretends it never happened.</p>
